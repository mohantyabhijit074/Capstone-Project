       "'(CNN)For the second time during his papacy, Pope Francis has announced a new group of bishops and archbishops set to become cardinals -- and they come from all over the world.\\n\\nPope Francis said Sunday that he would hold a meeting of cardinals on February 14 \"during which I will name 15 new Cardinals who, coming from 13 countries from every continent, manifest the indissoluble links between the Church of Rome and the particular Churches present in the world,\" according to Vatican Radio.\\n\\nNew cardinals are always important because they set the tone in the church and also elect the next pope, CNN Senior Vatican Analyst John L. Allen said. They are sometimes referred to as the princes of the Catholic Church.\\n\\nThe new cardinals come from countries such as Ethiopia, New Zealand and Myanmar.\\n\\n\"This is a pope who very much wants to reach out to people on the margins, and you clearly see that in this set,\" Allen said. \"You\\'re talking about cardinals from typically overlooked places, like Cape Verde, the Pacific island of Tonga, Panama, Thailand, Uruguay.\"\\n\\nBut for the second time since Francis\\' election, no Americans made the list.\\n\\n\"Francis\\' pattern is very clear: He wants to go to the geographical peripheries rather than places that are already top-heavy with cardinals,\" Allen said.\\n\\nChristopher Bellitto, a professor of church history at Kean University in New Jersey, noted that Francis announced his new slate of cardinals on the Catholic Feast of the Epiphany, which commemorates the visit of the Magi to Jesus\\' birthplace in Bethlehem.\\n\\n\"On feast of three wise men from far away, the Pope\\'s choices for cardinal say that every local church deserves a place at the big table.\"\\n\\nIn other words, Francis wants a more decentralized church and wants to hear reform ideas from small communities that sit far from Catholicism\\'s power centers, Bellitto said.\\n\\nThat doesn\\'t mean Francis is the first pontiff to appoint cardinals from the developing world, though. Beginning in the 1920s, an increasing number of Latin American churchmen were named cardinals, and in the 1960s, St. John XXIII, whom Francis canonized last year, appointed the first cardinals from Japan, the Philippines and Africa.\\n\\nIn addition to the 15 new cardinals Francis named on Sunday, five retired archbishops and bishops will also be honored as cardinals.\\n\\nLast year, Pope Francis appointed 19 new cardinals, including bishops from Haiti and Burkina Faso.\\n\\nCNN\\'s Daniel Burke and Christabelle Fombu contributed to this report.\\n\\n@highlight\\n\\nThe 15 new cardinals will be installed on February 14\\n\\n@highlight\\n\\nThey come from countries such as Myanmar and Tonga\\n\\n@highlight\\n\\nNo Americans made the list this time or the previous time in Francis\\' papacy'"

       "      <td>It's official: U.S. President Barack Obama wants lawmakers to weigh in on whether to use military force in Syria.\\n\\nObama sent a letter to the heads of the House and Senate on Saturday night, hours after announcing that he believes military action against Syrian targets is the right step to take over the alleged use of chemical weapons.\\n\\nThe proposed legislation from Obama asks Congress to approve the use of military force \"to deter, disrupt, prevent and degrade the potential for future uses of chemical weapons or other weapons of mass destruction.\"\\n\\nIt's a step that is set to turn an international crisis into a fierce domestic political battle.\\n\\nThere are key questions looming over the debate: What did U.N. weapons inspectors find in Syria? What happens if Congress votes no? And how will the Syrian government react?\\n\\nIn a televised address from the White House Rose Garden earlier Saturday, the president said he would take his case to Congress, not because he has to -- but because he wants to.\\n\\n\"While I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course, and our actions will be even more effective,\" he said. \"We should have this debate, because the issues are too big for business as usual.\"\\n\\nObama said top congressional leaders had agreed to schedule a debate when the body returns to Washington on September 9. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will hold a hearing over the matter on Tuesday, Sen. Robert Menendez said.\\n\\nTranscript: Read Obama's full remarks\\n\\nSyrian crisis: Latest developments\\n\\nU.N. inspectors leave Syria\\n\\nObama's remarks came shortly after U.N. inspectors left Syria, carrying evidence that will determine whether chemical weapons were used in an attack early last week in a Damascus suburb.\\n\\n\"The aim of the game here, the mandate, is very clear -- and that is to ascertain whether chemical weapons were used -- and not by whom,\" U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky told reporters on Saturday.\\n\\nBut who used the weapons in the reported toxic gas attack in a Damascus suburb on August 21 has been a key point of global debate over the Syrian crisis.\\n\\nTop U.S. officials have said there's no doubt that the Syrian government was behind it, while Syrian officials have denied responsibility and blamed jihadists fighting with the rebels.\\n\\nBritish and U.S. intelligence reports say the attack involved chemical weapons, but U.N. officials have stressed the importance of waiting for an official report from inspectors.\\n\\nThe inspectors will share their findings with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon Ban, who has said he wants to wait until the U.N. team's final report is completed before presenting it to the U.N. Security Council.\\n\\nThe Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which nine of the inspectors belong to, said Saturday that it could take up to three weeks to analyze the evidence they collected.\\n\\n\"It needs time to be able to analyze the information and the samples,\" Nesirky said.\\n\\nHe noted that Ban has repeatedly said there is no alternative to a political solution to the crisis in Syria, and that \"a military solution is not an option.\"\\n\\nBergen:  Syria is a problem from hell for the U.S.\\n\\nObama: 'This menace must be confronted'\\n\\nObama's senior advisers have debated the next steps to take, and the president's comments Saturday came amid mounting political pressure over the situation in Syria. Some U.S. lawmakers have called for immediate action while others warn of stepping into what could become a quagmire.\\n\\nSome global leaders have expressed support, but the British Parliament's vote against military action earlier this week was a blow to Obama's hopes of getting strong backing from key NATO allies.\\n\\nOn Saturday, Obama proposed what he said would be a limited military action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Any military attack would not be open-ended or include U.S. ground forces, he said.\\n\\nSyria's alleged use of chemical weapons earlier this month \"is an assault on human dignity,\" the president said.\\n\\nA failure to respond with force, Obama argued,  \"could lead to escalating use of chemical weapons or their proliferation to terrorist groups who would do our people harm. In a world with many dangers, this menace must be confronted.\"\\n\\nSyria missile strike: What would happen next?\\n\\nMap: U.S. and allied assets around Syria\\n\\nObama decision came Friday night\\n\\nOn Friday night, the president made a last-minute decision to consult lawmakers.\\n\\nWhat will happen if they vote no?\\n\\nIt's unclear. A senior administration official told CNN that Obama has the authority to act without Congress -- even if Congress rejects his request for authorization to use force.\\n\\nObama on Saturday continued to shore up support for a strike on the al-Assad government.\\n\\nHe spoke by phone with French President Francois Hollande before his Rose Garden speech.\\n\\n\"The two leaders agreed that the international community must deliver a resolute message to the Assad regime -- and others who would consider using chemical weapons -- that these crimes are unacceptable and those who violate this international norm will be held accountable by the world,\" the White House said.\\n\\nMeanwhile, as uncertainty loomed over how Congress would weigh in, U.S. military officials said they remained at the ready.\\n\\n5 key assertions: U.S. intelligence report on Syria\\n\\nSyria: Who wants what after chemical weapons horror\\n\\nReactions mixed to Obama's speech\\n\\nA spokesman for the Syrian National Coalition said that the opposition group was disappointed by Obama's announcement.\\n\\n\"Our fear now is that the lack of action could embolden the regime and they repeat his attacks in a more serious way,\" said spokesman Louay Safi. \"So we are quite concerned.\"\\n\\nSome members of Congress applauded Obama's decision.\\n\\nHouse Speaker John Boehner, Majority Leader Eric Cantor, Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy and Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers issued a statement Saturday praising the president.\\n\\n\"Under the Constitution, the responsibility to declare war lies with Congress,\" the Republican lawmakers said. \"We are glad the president is seeking authorization for any military action in Syria in response to serious, substantive questions being raised.\"\\n\\nMore than 160 legislators, including 63 of Obama's fellow Democrats, had signed letters calling for either a vote or at least a \"full debate\" before any U.S. action.\\n\\nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron, whose own attempt to get lawmakers in his country to support military action in Syria failed earlier this week, responded to Obama's speech in a Twitter post Saturday.\\n\\n\"I understand and support Barack Obama's position on Syria,\" Cameron said.\\n\\nAn influential lawmaker in Russia -- which has stood by Syria and criticized the United States -- had his own theory.\\n\\n\"The main reason Obama is turning to the Congress:  the military operation did not get enough support either in the world, among allies of the US or in the United States itself,\" Alexei Pushkov, chairman of the international-affairs committee of the Russian State Duma, said in a Twitter post.\\n\\nIn the United States, scattered groups of anti-war protesters around the country took to the streets Saturday.\\n\\n\"Like many other Americans...we're just tired of the United States getting involved and invading and bombing other countries,\" said Robin Rosecrans, who was among hundreds at a Los Angeles demonstration.\\n\\nWhat do Syria's neighbors think?\\n\\nWhy Russia, China, Iran stand by Assad\\n\\nSyria's government unfazed\\n\\nAfter Obama's speech, a military and political analyst on Syrian state TV said Obama is \"embarrassed\" that Russia opposes military action against Syria, is \"crying for help\" for someone to come to his rescue and is facing two defeats -- on the political and military levels.\\n\\nSyria's prime minister appeared unfazed by the saber-rattling.\\n\\n\"The Syrian Army's status is on maximum readiness and fingers are on the trigger to confront all challenges,\" Wael Nader al-Halqi said during a meeting with a delegation of Syrian expatriates from Italy, according to a banner on Syria State TV that was broadcast prior to Obama's address.\\n\\nAn anchor on Syrian state television said Obama \"appeared to be preparing for an aggression on Syria based on repeated lies.\"\\n\\nA top Syrian diplomat told the state television network that Obama was facing pressure to take military action from Israel, Turkey, some Arabs and right-wing extremists in the United States.\\n\\n\"I think he has done well by doing what Cameron did in terms of taking the issue to Parliament,\" said Bashar Jaafari, Syria's ambassador to the United Nations.\\n\\nBoth Obama and Cameron, he said, \"climbed to the top of the tree and don't know how to get down.\"\\n\\nThe Syrian government has denied that it used chemical weapons in the August 21 attack, saying that jihadists fighting with the rebels used them in an effort to turn global sentiments against it.\\n\\nBritish intelligence had put the number of people killed in the attack at more than 350.\\n\\nOn Saturday, Obama said \"all told, well over 1,000 people were murdered.\" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Friday cited a death toll of 1,429, more than 400 of them children. No explanation was offered for the discrepancy.\\n\\nIran: U.S. military action in Syria would spark 'disaster'\\n\\nOpinion: Why strikes in Syria are a bad idea\\n\\n</td>\n",

       "0  It's official: U.S. President Barack Obama wants lawmakers to weigh in on whether to use military force in Syria.\\n\\nObama sent a letter to the heads of the House and Senate on Saturday night, hours after announcing that he believes military action against Syrian targets is the right step to take over the alleged use of chemical weapons.\\n\\nThe proposed legislation from Obama asks Congress to approve the use of military force \"to deter, disrupt, prevent and degrade the potential for future uses of chemical weapons or other weapons of mass destruction.\"\\n\\nIt's a step that is set to turn an international crisis into a fierce domestic political battle.\\n\\nThere are key questions looming over the debate: What did U.N. weapons inspectors find in Syria? What happens if Congress votes no? And how will the Syrian government react?\\n\\nIn a televised address from the White House Rose Garden earlier Saturday, the president said he would take his case to Congress, not because he has to -- but because he wants to.\\n\\n\"While I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course, and our actions will be even more effective,\" he said. \"We should have this debate, because the issues are too big for business as usual.\"\\n\\nObama said top congressional leaders had agreed to schedule a debate when the body returns to Washington on September 9. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will hold a hearing over the matter on Tuesday, Sen. Robert Menendez said.\\n\\nTranscript: Read Obama's full remarks\\n\\nSyrian crisis: Latest developments\\n\\nU.N. inspectors leave Syria\\n\\nObama's remarks came shortly after U.N. inspectors left Syria, carrying evidence that will determine whether chemical weapons were used in an attack early last week in a Damascus suburb.\\n\\n\"The aim of the game here, the mandate, is very clear -- and that is to ascertain whether chemical weapons were used -- and not by whom,\" U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky told reporters on Saturday.\\n\\nBut who used the weapons in the reported toxic gas attack in a Damascus suburb on August 21 has been a key point of global debate over the Syrian crisis.\\n\\nTop U.S. officials have said there's no doubt that the Syrian government was behind it, while Syrian officials have denied responsibility and blamed jihadists fighting with the rebels.\\n\\nBritish and U.S. intelligence reports say the attack involved chemical weapons, but U.N. officials have stressed the importance of waiting for an official report from inspectors.\\n\\nThe inspectors will share their findings with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon Ban, who has said he wants to wait until the U.N. team's final report is completed before presenting it to the U.N. Security Council.\\n\\nThe Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which nine of the inspectors belong to, said Saturday that it could take up to three weeks to analyze the evidence they collected.\\n\\n\"It needs time to be able to analyze the information and the samples,\" Nesirky said.\\n\\nHe noted that Ban has repeatedly said there is no alternative to a political solution to the crisis in Syria, and that \"a military solution is not an option.\"\\n\\nBergen:  Syria is a problem from hell for the U.S.\\n\\nObama: 'This menace must be confronted'\\n\\nObama's senior advisers have debated the next steps to take, and the president's comments Saturday came amid mounting political pressure over the situation in Syria. Some U.S. lawmakers have called for immediate action while others warn of stepping into what could become a quagmire.\\n\\nSome global leaders have expressed support, but the British Parliament's vote against military action earlier this week was a blow to Obama's hopes of getting strong backing from key NATO allies.\\n\\nOn Saturday, Obama proposed what he said would be a limited military action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

       "      <td>it is official u.s. president barack obama wants lawmakers to weigh in on whether to use military force in syria. obama sent a letter to the heads of the house and senate on saturday night, hours after announcing that he believes military action against syrian targets is the right step to take over the alleged use of chemical weapons. the proposed legislation from obama asks congress to approve the use of military force to deter, disrupt, prevent and degrade the potential for future uses of chemical weapons or other weapons of mass destruction. it is a step that is set to turn an international crisis into a fierce domestic political battle. there are key questions looming over the debate what did u.n. weapons inspectors find in syria what happens if congress votes no and how will the syrian government react in a televised address from the white house rose garden earlier saturday, the president said he would take his case to congress, not because he has to but because he wants to. while i believe i have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, i know that the country will be stronger if we take this course, and our actions will be even more effective, he said. we should have this debate, because the issues are too big for business as usual. obama said top congressional leaders had agreed to schedule a debate when the body returns to washington on september 9. the senate foreign relations committee will hold a hearing over the matter on tuesday, sen. robert menendez said. transcript read obama is full remarks syrian crisis latest developments u.n. inspectors leave syria obama is remarks came shortly after u.n. inspectors left syria, carrying evidence that will determine whether chemical weapons were used in an attack early last week in a damascus suburb. the aim of the game here, the mandate, is very clear and that is to ascertain whether chemical weapons were used and not by whom, u.n. spokesman martin nesirky told reporters on saturday. but who used the weapons in the reported toxic gas attack in a damascus suburb on august 21 has been a key point of global debate over the syrian crisis. top u.s. officials have said there is no doubt that the syrian government was behind it, while syrian officials have denied responsibility and blamed jihadists fighting with the rebels. british and u.s. intelligence reports say the attack involved chemical weapons, but u.n. officials have stressed the importance of waiting for an official report from inspectors. the inspectors will share their findings with u.n. secretary general ban ki moon ban, who has said he wants to wait until the u.n. team is final report is completed before presenting it to the u.n. security council. the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons, which nine of the inspectors belong to, said saturday that it could take up to three weeks to analyze the evidence they collected. it needs time to be able to analyze the information and the samples, nesirky said. he noted that ban has repeatedly said there is no alternative to a political solution to the crisis in syria, and that a military solution is not an option. bergen syria is a problem from hell for the u.s. obama this menace must be confronted obama is senior advisers have debated the next steps to take, and the president is comments saturday came amid mounting political pressure over the situation in syria. some u.s. lawmakers have called for immediate action while others warn of stepping into what could become a quagmire. some global leaders have expressed support, but the british parliament is vote against military action earlier this week was a blow to obama is hopes of getting strong backing from key nato allies. on saturday, obama proposed what he said would be a limited military action against syrian president bashar al assad. any military attack would not be open ended or include u.s. ground forces, he said. syria is alleged use of chemical weapons earlier this month is an assault on human dignity, the president said. a failure to respond with force, obama argued, could lead to escalating use of chemical weapons or their proliferation to terrorist groups who would do our people harm. in a world with many dangers, this menace must be confronted. syria missile strike what would happen next map u.s. and allied assets around syria obama decision came friday night on friday night, the president made a last minute decision to consult lawmakers. what will happen if they vote no it is unclear. a senior administration official told that obama has the authority to act without congress even if congress rejects his request for authorization to use force. obama on saturday continued to shore up support for a strike on the al assad government. he spoke by phone with french president francois hollande before his rose garden speech. the two leaders agreed that the international community must deliver a resolute message to the assad regime and others who would consider using chemical weapons that these crimes are unacceptable and those who violate this international norm will be held accountable by the world, the white house said. meanwhile, as uncertainty loomed over how congress would weigh in, u.s. military officials said they remained at the ready. 5 key assertions u.s. intelligence report on syria syria who wants what after chemical weapons horror reactions mixed to obama is speech a spokesman for the syrian national coalition said that the opposition group was disappointed by obama is announcement. our fear now is that the lack of action could embolden the regime and they repeat his attacks in a more serious way, said spokesman louay safi. so we are quite concerned. some members of congress applauded obama is decision. house speaker john boehner, majority leader eric cantor, majority whip kevin mccarthy and conference chair cathy mcmorris rodgers issued a statement saturday praising the president. under the constitution, the responsibility to declare war lies with congress, the republican lawmakers said. we are glad the president is seeking authorization for any military action in syria in response to serious, substantive questions being raised. more than 160 legislators, including 63 of obama is fellow democrats, had signed letters calling for either a vote or at least a full debate before any u.s. action. british prime minister david cameron, whose own attempt to get lawmakers in his country to support military action in syria failed earlier this week, responded to obama is speech in a twitter post saturday. i understand and support barack obama is position on syria, cameron said. an influential lawmaker in russia which has stood by syria and criticized the united states had his own theory. the main reason obama is turning to the congress the military operation did not get enough support either in the world, among allies of the us or in the united states itself, alexei pushkov, chairman of the international affairs committee of the russian state duma, said in a twitter post. in the united states, scattered groups of anti war protesters around the country took to the streets saturday. like many other americans...we are just tired of the united states getting involved and invading and bombing other countries, said robin rosecrans, who was among hundreds at a los angeles demonstration. what do syria is neighbors think why russia, china, iran stand by assad syria is government unfazed after obama is speech, a military and political analyst on syrian state tv said obama is embarrassed that russia opposes military action against syria, is crying for help for someone to come to his rescue and is facing two defeats on the political and military levels. syria is prime minister appeared unfazed by the saber rattling. the syrian army is status is on maximum readiness and fingers are on the trigger to confront all challenges, wael nader al halqi said during a meeting with a delegation of syrian expatriates from italy, according to a banner on syria state tv that was broadcast prior to obama is address. an anchor on syrian state television said obama appeared to be preparing for an aggression on syria based on repeated lies. a top syrian diplomat told the state television network that obama was facing pressure to take military action from israel, turkey, some arabs and right wing extremists in the united states. i think he has done well by doing what cameron did in terms of taking the issue to parliament, said bashar jaafari, syria is ambassador to the united nations. both obama and cameron, he said, climbed to the top of the tree and do not know how to get down. the syrian government has denied that it used chemical weapons in the august 21 attack, saying that jihadists fighting with the rebels used them in an effort to turn global sentiments against it. british intelligence had put the number of people killed in the attack at more than 350. on saturday, obama said all told, well over 1,000 people were murdered. u.s. secretary of state john kerry on friday cited a death toll of 1,429, more than 400 of them children. no explanation was offered for the discrepancy. iran u.s. military action in syria would spark wouldisaster opinion

       "      <td>usain bolt rounded off the world championships sunday by claiming his third gold in moscow as he anchored jamaica to victory in the men is 4x100m relay. the fastest man in the world charged clear of united states rival justin gatlin as the jamaican quartet of nesta carter, kemar bailey cole, nickel ashmeade and bolt won in 37.36 seconds. the u.s finished second in 37.56 seconds with canada taking the bronze after britain were disqualified for a faulty handover. the 26 year old bolt has now collected eight gold medals at world championships, equaling the record held by american trio carl lewis, michael johnson and allyson felix, not to mention the small matter of six olympic titles. the relay triumph followed individual successes in the 100 and 200 meters in the russian capital. i am proud of myself and i will continue to work to dominate for as long as possible, bolt said, having previously expressed his intention to carry on until the 2016 rio olympics. victory was never seriously in doubt once he got the baton safely in hand from ashmeade, while gatlin and the united states third leg runner rakieem salaam had problems. gatlin strayed out of his lane as he struggled to get full control of their baton and was never able to get on terms with bolt. earlier, jamaica is women underlined their dominance in the sprint events by winning the 4x100m relay gold, anchored by shelly ann fraser pryce, who like bolt was completing a triple. their quartet recorded a championship record of 41.29 seconds, well clear of france, who crossed the line in second place in 42.73 seconds. defending champions, the united states, were initially back in the bronze medal position after losing time on the second handover between alexandria anderson and english gardner, but promoted to silver when france were subsequently disqualified for an illegal handover. the british quartet, who were initially fourth, were promoted to the bronze which eluded their men is team. fraser pryce, like bolt aged 26, became the first woman to achieve three golds in the 100 200 and the relay. in other final action on the last day of the championships, france is teddy tamgho became the third man to leap over 18m in the triple jump, exceeding the mark by four centimeters to take gold. germany is christina obergfoll finally took gold at global level in the women is javelin after five previous silvers, while kenya is asbel kiprop easily won a tactical men is 1500m final. kiprop is compatriot eunice jepkoech sum was a surprise winner of the women is 800m. bolt is final dash for golden glory brought the eight day championship to a rousing finale, but while the hosts topped the medal table from the united states there was criticism of the poor attendances in the luzhniki stadium. there was further concern when their pole vault gold medalist yelena isinbayeva made controversial remarks in support of russia is new laws, which make the propagandizing of non traditional sexual relations among minors a criminal offense. she later attempted to clarify her comments, but there were renewed calls by gay rights groups for a boycott of the 2014 winter games in sochi, the next major sports event in russia.</td>\n",

       "      <td>kansas city, missouri the general services administration, already under investigation for lavish spending, allowed an employee to telecommute from hawaii even though he is based at the gsa is kansas city, missouri, office, a investigation has found. it cost more than 24,000 for the business development specialist to travel to and from the mainland united states over the past year. he is among several hundred gsa virtual workers who also travel to various conferences and their home offices, costing the agency millions of dollars over the past three years. under the program, employees work from home and may live in another state from the region in which they are actually assigned. the kansas city employee, who started his job in january 2011, is paid 84,440 and works from his home in honolulu, a gsa representative confirmed. in the past year, according to gsa travel records, the employee has flown back to the mainland nine times for conferences and meetings. four of those trips were to st. louis four were to washington, with a side trip to cincinnati and one was to san diego. the total cost to taxpayers was 24,221. jason klumb, the gsa is regional administrator for kansas city, defended the hire. the cost of that travel was included in the consideration of his candidacy as an employee as compared with the other applicants, klumb said. and when factoring all of those in, it was determined that he was the best candidate, even in light of the cost that would be incurred. klumb called the gsa is teleworking program a successful program that is going to lead to cost savings for taxpayers. but a gsa spokeswoman said, we are not going to defend this type of travel. and a gsa employee in kansas city, who requested anonymity, said that hiring someone in hawaii to work for the kansas city region was ludicrous. it does not make sense, the employee said. when you consider everything you need when you hire someone, it would have been better to look for someone in the kansas city area. it would have reduced the cost of travel by at least 70 percent when you look at just the airfare of what it takes to from honolulu to washington, d.c., where a lot of business is done. dan tangherlini, who was appointed acting gsa administrator this year, said the agency was examining the cost of the entire teleworking program. i think the most important part for the gsa to think about is make sure we open ourselves up, avail ourselves to all the smart people in the country, but then also make sure we have a clear business case, he said. if we have someone who is working in nebraska but reporting to boston, there has to be a clear explanation for what value they are providing, and you have got to give me the business case. you have got to explain to me why that is a cost effective move for the american people, and that is a new standard that we are asking everyone at gsa to adhere to. the gsa virtual employee program is different from telework programs offered by many private companies including is parent company, turner broadcasting, in which some employees are encouraged to work from home some days of the week, partially to reduce traffic congestion. the house committee on oversight and government reform requested details about the gsa is teleworking program in june. that followed disclosures that 95 virtual employees, including 12 in supervisory positions, spent nearly 750,000 in travel costs between october 2010 and june 2011. the american people have a right to know that federal bureaucrats who enjoy the benefits of virtual work are eligible and responsible stewards of the taxpayer dollars that support the program, according to a letter from committee chairman rep. darrell issa, r california, to the gsa. the details requested by issa about the gsa program have not been provided to the committee. also requested the information more than two months ago through the federal freedom of information act but has been repeatedly told by the gsa that foia staff members have not finished compiling the material. the general services administration, which has more than 12,600 employees and a 26.3 billion budget, is a relatively obscure federal agency that handles government real estate and other non military procurement. congress launched an investigation into the gsa after a scathing inspector general is report issued this year showed lavish spending 823,000 at the agency is western regions conference in las vegas in october 2010. the controversy became politically toxic after reports and video clips of the lavish conference were released. the revelation prompted taxpayer indignation, embarrassed the administration and put a spotlight on wasteful spending by the gsa. jeff neely, the gsa official who organized the conference, resigned, as did the agency is administrator, martha johnson. two of johnson is deputies were fired, and eight other employees left the agency. tangherlini, a former treasury department official, took over as acting gsa administrator. in addition to the las vegas conference, the gsa apparently spent 330,000 to relocate an employee from denver to hawaii and probably millions more on other employees over a two year period, according to a transcript of an interview with a gsa event planner. and 84 gsa employees, most of them supervisors or other senior staff all subjects of inspector general investigations are still collecting their bonuses, totaling more than 1 million in taxpayer money. in july, a investigation revealed that the gsa is kansas city office spent more than 20,000 to send employees to cooking classes to build team spirit. while the classes do not amount to a significant sum of money in the world of trillion dollar government budgets, insiders said it was part of the free spending culture that went on for years at the gsa is kansas city regional headquarters. gsa spokeswoman betsaida alcantara said in a statement this year that all the agency is practices are under a top down review. is sara anwar, elizabeth m. nunez and tom cohen contributed to this report. watch erin burnett weekdays 7pm et. for the latest from erin

       "      <td>los angeles a medical doctor in vancouver, british columbia, said thursday that california arson suspect harry burkhart suffered from severe mental illness in 2010, when she examined him as part of a team of doctors. dr. blaga stancheva, a family physician and specialist in obstetrics, said both burkhart and his mother, dorothee, were her patients in vancouver while both were applying for refugee status in canada. i was asked to diagnose and treat harry to support a claim explaining why he was unable to show up in a small claims court case, stancheva told in a phone interview. she declined to cite the case or burkhart is role in it. stancheva said she and other doctors including a psychiatrist diagnosed burkhart with autism, severe anxiety, post traumatic stress disorder and depression. the diagnosis was spelled out in a letter she wrote for the small claims court case, stancheva said. stancheva, citing doctor patient confidentiality, would not elaborate further, nor would she identify the psychiatrist involved in the diagnosis. burkhart, a 24 year old german national, has been charged with 37 counts of arson following a string of 52 fires in los angeles. the charges are in connection with arson fires at 12 locations scattered through hollywood, west hollywood and sherman oaks, according to authorities. stancheva said the refugee applications by burkhart and his mother were denied by the canadian government, and she has not seen burkhart since early march of 2010. i was shocked and dismayed at what happened in los angeles, and it appears he was not being treated for his depression, she said. burkhart was in court on wednesday for a preliminary hearing. prosecutors said his rage against americans, triggered by his mother is arrest last week, motivated his campaign of terror with dozens of fires in hollywood and nearby communities. burkhart kept his eyes closed and remained limp during most of his hearing, requiring sheriff is deputies to hold him up. the district attorney called his courtroom behavior very bizarre. this defendant has engaged in a protracted campaign in which he has set, the people believe, upwards of 52 arson fires in what essentially amounts to a campaign of terror against this community, los angeles county deputy district attorney sean carney said. the people believe he has engaged in this conduct because he has a hatred for americans. carney told the court burkhart would flee the country if he was allowed out of jail on bond, but los angeles superior court judge upinder kalra said he had no choice but to set bail. to go free while awaiting trial, burkhart must post a 2.85 million bond and surrender his german passport. it was revealed that burkhart is also under investigation for arson and fraud in relation to a fire in neukirchen, near frankfurt, germany. the worst arson sprees in the city is history began last friday morning with a car fire in hollywood that spread to apartments above a garage, but no new fires have happened since burkhart was arrested monday, los angeles district attorney steve cooley said. no one was hurt in the fires, but property damage costs are likely to reach 3 million, authorities said. cooley called it almost attempted murder, because people were sleeping in apartments above where burkhart allegedly set cars on fire with incendiary devices placed under their engines. the criminal complaint filed wednesday also alleged that the fires were caused by use of a device designed to accelerate the fire, cooley said. if found true, the allegation could mean additional custody time for the defendant. in numerous instances, the cars were parked in carports, resulting in the fires spreading to the adjacent occupied apartment buildings, a sworn affidavit from a los angeles arson investigator said. the vast majority of these fires occurred late at night when the occupants of the apartment buildings were asleep. investigator edward nordskog is affidavit detailed burkhart is behavior a day before the fires began, when he was in a federal courtroom during extradition proceedings for his mother. while in the audience, the defendant burkhart began yelling in an angry manner, f k all americans. the defendant also attempted to communicate with his mother who was in custody. shortly thereafter, the defendant was ejected from the courtroom by deputy u.s. marshals, nordskog wrote. dorothee burkhart was arrested a day before on an international arrest warrant issued by a district court in frankfurt, germany, said federal court spokesman gunther meilinger. the 53 year old german woman is wanted on 16 counts of fraud and three counts of embezzlement, he said. the charges include an allegation that she failed to pay for a breast enhancement operation performed on her in 2004, meilinger said. most of the german charges, however, stem from phony real estate deals that dorothee burkhart allegedly conducted between 2000 and 2006. it is my opinion that the defendant is criminal spree was motivated by his rage against americans and that by setting these fires the defendant intended to harm and terrorize as many residents of the city and county of los angeles as possible, nordskog wrote. a search of burkhart is hollywood apartment found newspaper clippings about the los angeles fires and articles from germany reporting similar car fires in frankfurt, germany in september, 2011, the investigator said. it is my opinion based on my experience that it is highly likely the defendant has a history of setting arson fires in germany before he came to the united states, nordskog wrote. burkhart is mother is scheduled for another extradition hearing friday, while he is due back in court for arraignment on january 24. meanwhile, both burkharts are housed in a los angeles jail.</td>\n",

       "      <td>police arrested another teen thursday, the sixth suspect jailed in connection with the gang rape of a 15 year old girl on a northern california high school campus. jose carlos montano, 18, was arrested on charges of felony rape, rape in concert with force, and penetration with a foreign object, said richmond police lt. mark gagan. montano was arrested thursday evening in san pablo, california, a small town about two miles from the city of richmond, where the crime took place. montano, who was held in lieu of 1.3 million bail, is accused of taking part in what police said was a 2 hour assault on the richmond high school campus. police said as many as 10 people were involved in the rape in a dimly lit back alley at the school, while another 10 people watched without calling 911. the victim was taken to the hospital in critical condition, but was released wednesday. four other teenage suspects were arraigned thursday on charges connected to the rape. cody ray smith, described by the court as older than 14, pleaded not guilty to charges of rape with a foreign object and rape by force. two other juveniles, ari abdallah morales and marcelles james peter, appeared with smith at the contra costa county superior court, but did not enter a plea. the court described morales as younger than 16, and did not give an age for peter. all three juveniles, who wore bulletproof vests at the hearing, were charged as adults. a fourth person, manuel ortega, 19, appeared separately without an attorney and did not enter a plea. he did not wear a protective vest. another person, salvador rodriguez, 21, was arrested tuesday night, but he was not in court thursday.</td>\n",

       "      <td>washington a second grand jury is decision not to indict a white police officer in the death of an unarmed black man once again had ripple effects that quickly spread from the streets on new york city to reach the halls of capitol hill. the decision not to indict a new york city police officer in the chokehold death of eric garner, a black man who was suspected of illegally selling cigarettes, came just nine days after another grand jury decided not to indict a white police officer in ferguson, missouri in the death of black teenager michael brown. the news led to another night of protests in major cities nationwide, including washington, d.c. president barack obama vowed not to let up in his efforts to ease racial tensions, and some democrats tried to channel demonstrators outrage in their reactions overnight and into thursday morning. and it was a rare development that brought members of both parties together in calling for further investigation. rep. cathy mcmorris rodgers, chairwoman of the house republican conference, said thursday morning that the house should absolutely hold hearings to investigate garner is death. we all have a lot of serious questions that need to be addressed and we need to understand what happened, why this decision was made, mcmorris rodgers said on msnbc is morning joe. i would call for the house to have those hearings so that we can better understand. but we need to take action, appropriate action, making sure our local law enforcement have the training, that they are using appropriate force, which i think we all recognize these are tragedies and it has raised a lot of questions. referring to rodgers call for hearings, house speaker john boehner said he would not rule that in or out, but said there are a lot of unanswered questions that americans have, and frankly i have. i do think that the american people deserve more answers about what really happened here and was our system of justice handled properly, boehner said thursday during a press conference. black leaders in congress quickly slammed the decision not to indict new york city police officer daniel pantaleo in garner is death and called on the department of justice to investigate garner is death. rep. marcia fudge, chairwoman of the congressional black caucus, said wednesday she was deeply disappointed in the decision not to indict pantaleo in garner is death and called the grand jury is decision yet another sad day for our country and our democracy. in the span of two weeks, this nation seems to have heard one message loud and clear there will be no accountability for taking black lives. as an american, it is growing increasingly difficult to believe that there is justice for all, she said in a statement. black lives do matter and our lives do hold value. rep. hakeem jeffries, the black caucus incoming whip who represents parts of new york city, called the grand jury is decision a stunning miscarriage of justice in a statement wednesday and said the decision makes clear that equal protection under the law does not exist for all americans. and jeffries said thursday that the incidents should serve as a catalyst for a wide shakeup in how cases involving police misconduct and potential crimes should be prosecuted. we need to look at broader reform and whether these type of cases should be handled by independent, special prosecutors so that we can have some measure of fairness and a real full and fair investigation, jeffries said on is new day. jeffries called the altercation between garner and the police officer, which was caught on video, a living breathing example of probable cause to indict. nearly a dozen times, garner tries telling the officer that he can not breathe and jeffries noted that garner even put his hands up in the air, but pantaleo continued to choke him. protests featuring slogans like hands up, do not shoot, black lives matter and now i can not breathe broke out again wednesday in reaction to the staten island grand jury is decision as demonstrators called for justice for garner and brown, the black teenager who was shot by police officer darren wilson in ferguson this summer. amid outcry from democrats on capitol hill and mostly silence from congressional republicans, two new york gop congressman defended the grand jury is decision wednesday not to indict nypd officer pantaleo. rep. peter king thanked the grand jury on twitter for doing justice and said later on that he felt strongly the police officer should not have been indicted. related rep. peter king thanks staten island grand jury for wouldoing justice rep. michael grimm, who represents staten island in congress, called the grand jury decision fair and reasoned in a statement wednesday and thanked the district attorney in the incident for handling the grand jury case with the utmost integrity. staten island is new york is whitest burrough and a majority of the grand jurors in the case were white. grimm did not fare so well at the hands of another grand jury last spring, when he was indicted on tax and other fraud charges. u.s. attorney general eric holder heeded calls from congressional leaders to launch a federal investigation and later wednesday formally announced that the justice department is leading a civil rights investigation into garner is death. president obama had also weighed in wednesday saying he had spoken with holder and said we are not going to let up until we see a strengthening of the trust and a strengthening of accountability that exists between our communities and law enforcement. holder is announcement came after sen. kirsten gillibrand of new york joined members of the congressional black caucus in calling on the justice department to investigate the staten island death. sen. kirsten gillibrand called the decision shocking and called garner is death a tragedy that demands accountability. nobody unarmed should die on a new york city street corner for suspected low level offenses, she said in a statement. u.s. attorney loretta lynch, obama is nominee to succeed holder as u.s. attorney general, will lead the investigation into garner is death. sen. chuck schumer, also of new york, said he was confident lynch will conduct a tough but fair investigation into the tragic death of eric garner. sen. rand paul, a kentucky republican and would be 2016 presidential contender who has specialized in reaching out to minority voters, blamed high taxes on cigarettes in the empire state as partially to blame for putting police officers in a dangerous situation with bad laws. .</td>\n",

       "      <td>los angeles california gov. jerry brown will seek an immediate stay of what he called an unprecedented federal court order to release almost 10,000 inmates to relieve prison overcrowding by the end of the year, he said thursday. a three judge federal court panel ordered the state to reduce its prison population to 137.5 of design capacity by december 31 and threatened to find the state in contempt if california does not report on its progress every two weeks, thursday is ruling said. california has the nation is largest prison system and says it has been reducing overcrowding. the case grows out of lawsuits filed in 1990 and 2001 that alleged overcrowding is at the core of a domino effect of unsafe and unhealthy conditions for those on both sides of the iron bars. when plaintiffs filed motions to convene the three judge court panel in november 2006, california is prisons were at 202 of design capacity. in 2011, the u.s. supreme court upheld a three judge federal panel is determination that california is medical and mental health care for inmates falls below a constitutional level of care and that the only way to meet the requirements is by reducing prison crowding. the supreme court in 2011 found that california is shortcomings in prison medical and mental health care resulted in needless suffering and death and recognized the federal court is prison reduction order was of unprecedented sweep and extent, thursday is ruling said. the high court affirmed that order in full in 2011. on thursday, the three u.s. district court judges expressed impatience with california officials, the defendants in the case. the history of this litigation is of defendants repeated failure to take the necessary steps to remedy the constitutional violations in its prison system, the order said. it is defendants unwillingness to comply with this court is orders that requires us to order additional relief today. the three judge panel added that the plaintiffs request for a court order to show why california should not be held in contempt has considerable merit. our first priority, however, is to eliminate the deprivation of constitutional liberties in the california prison system, the three judges said in their ruling. we will therefore defer ruling on plaintiffs motion, and defer instituting any contempt proceedings related to defendants prior acts until after we are able to determine whether defendants will comply with this order. court documents also show that defer was not only all capitalized but also printed in bold face.</td>\n",

       "      <td>norfolk, virginia the second mate of the houston express probably could not believe what he was seeing. hundreds of miles from land there was a small boat nearby. at first it looked abandoned. it was in bad shape, listing to one side. the crew of the 1,000 foot long container ship thought it was a yacht that had wrecked. incredibly, as they got closer, they saw there was a man on it, signaling for help. he was moving, walking around, waving to us and in surprisingly good condition, capt. thomas grenz told by phone friday. that man, louis jordan, 37, had an amazing story. he would been drifting on the 35 foot pearson sailboat for more than two months since leaving conway, south carolina, to fish in the ocean. just a few days into his trip, a storm capsized his boat and broke his mast. one of his shoulders was broken, too, so he could not fix the boat right away. eventually he was able to rig a makeshift mast and sail, but he could make little headway against the currents. it took so long, jordan said. it moved so slowly. the boat capsized two more times before he was rescued, according to jordan. his father, frank jordan, told is jim sciutto that he was expecting his son to look different. he looked good. had not lost too much weight. he was not badly sunburned like i thought he probably would be, he said. lost at sea for 66 days after his food and water ran out, it became an issue of survival. collecting fresh water was a nightmare for jordan. the weather would not cooperate. records show there were more than a dozen storms off the coast of the carolinas during the time he was missing. the precipitation came at night during harsh conditions. i had tried to collect rain water ... but every time the waves would splash into the boat, jordan said. the waves would put saltwater into my freshwater and it tasted bad. finally the conditions were right. i filled up my water tank, which is 25 gallons. i filled up a bucket. then there was the issue of food. the fish were not cooperating, but after a while jordan learned they were attracted to his laundry, which he would put out to sea for a rinse. the fish would swim in and out of his clothes and he could easily scoop them up with a hand net, he said. jordan came ashore thursday evening. affiliate wavy in norfolk, virginia, reported that he was able to walk from the helicopter into sentara norfolk general hospital about 7 30 p.m. coast guard officials have said they have found no reason to doubt jordan is incredible story. they noted that his father contacted them january 29 to report his son and his boat missing. frank jordan addressed the skepticism about his son is appearance, saying the boat stayed afloat and upright most of the time. his son spent most of his days in the cabin, out of the sun. frank jordan said it was obvious when the jordans met at the hospital friday morning that his normally low key and private son had been through an ordeal. i know he went through what he went through, frank jordan said. jordan is an unemployed truck driver who lived on his boat at a marina in conway. he had free rent and free food in the river, he said. but when it became difficult to catch dinner, he took off for the ocean in hopes he would land some bigger fish. frank jordan told is wolf blitzer on thursday that he had worried about his son, who is an inexperienced sailor, but he held hope because his son had a good boat. and he had the strength to make it. he is got a very strong constitution and is strong not only physically, but spiritually, frank jordan said. and he told me on the phone that he was praying the whole time, so i believe that sustained him a great deal. rescue swimmer kyle mccollum was the first to care for jordan on the flight back to land. you would expect sunburns, severe sunburn, blisters maybe ... a bunch of medical issues that could possibly be wrong with him, he said. but for him to be in his current state was pretty amazing. grenz was also surprised by jordan is condition, physically and mentally. the rescued sailor knew almost exactly what day it was, remarkable for someone who had been on the water for more than 60 days. jordan was dehydrated and said he was hungry. we took him to a rescue boat, the container ship captain said. he was given water and pea soup to gain some power again. derriel morris, a neighbor at the bucksport plantation marina rv resort called jordan a nice guy who loved his 47 year old boat, named angel. morris said it was immaculate, it was gorgeous, beautifully painted. i mean it looked like a brand new sailboat. morris told affiliate wpde that one day in january he was going to the store and jordan asked him to bring back some coffee creamer. but when he returned to the marina, jordan had slipped away. there was no shore line, no hose it was like he was never there, morris told the station. after he disappeared others who also live there held a candlelight ceremony. the marina is manager, jeff weeks, told wpde that jordan is expected to be back at buscksport next week. tales of people who cheated death after days, weeks adrift</td>\n",

       "0      it is official u.s. president barack obama wants lawmakers to weigh in on whether to use military force in syria. obama sent a letter to the heads of the house and senate on saturday night, hours after announcing that he believes military action against syrian targets is the right step to take over the alleged use of chemical weapons. the proposed legislation from obama asks congress to approve the use of military force to deter, disrupt, prevent and degrade the potential for future uses of chemical weapons or other weapons of mass destruction. it is a step that is set to turn an international crisis into a fierce domestic political battle. there are key questions looming over the debate what did u.n. weapons inspectors find in syria what happens if congress votes no and how will the syrian government react in a televised address from the white house rose garden earlier saturday, the president said he would take his case to congress, not because he has to but because he wants to. while i believe i have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, i know that the country will be stronger if we take this course, and our actions will be even more effective, he said. we should have this debate, because the issues are too big for business as usual. obama said top congressional leaders had agreed to schedule a debate when the body returns to washington on september 9. the senate foreign relations committee will hold a hearing over the matter on tuesday, sen. robert menendez said. transcript read obama is full remarks syrian crisis latest developments u.n. inspectors leave syria obama is remarks came shortly after u.n. inspectors left syria, carrying evidence that will determine whether chemical weapons were used in an attack early last week in a damascus suburb. the aim of the game here, the mandate, is very clear and that is to ascertain whether chemical weapons were used and not by whom, u.n. spokesman martin nesirky told reporters on saturday. but who used the weapons in the reported toxic gas attack in a damascus suburb on august 21 has been a key point of global debate over the syrian crisis. top u.s. officials have said there is no doubt that the syrian government was behind it, while syrian officials have denied responsibility and blamed jihadists fighting with the rebels. british and u.s. intelligence reports say the attack involved chemical weapons, but u.n. officials have stressed the importance of waiting for an official report from inspectors. the inspectors will share their findings with u.n. secretary general ban ki moon ban, who has said he wants to wait until the u.n. team is final report is completed before presenting it to the u.n. security council. the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons, which nine of the inspectors belong to, said saturday that it could take up to three weeks to analyze the evidence they collected. it needs time to be able to analyze the information and the samples, nesirky said. he noted that ban has repeatedly said there is no alternative to a political solution to the crisis in syria, and that a military solution is not an option. bergen syria is a problem from hell for the u.s. obama this menace must be confronted obama is senior advisers have debated the next steps to take, and the president is comments saturday came amid mounting political pressure over the situation in syria. some u.s. lawmakers have called for immediate action while others warn of stepping into what could become a quagmire. some global leaders have expressed support, but the british parliament is vote against military action earlier this week was a blow to obama is hopes of getting strong backing from key nato allies. on saturday, obama proposed what he said would be a limited military action against syrian president bashar al assad. any military attack would not be open ended or include u.s. ground forces, he said. syria is alleged use of chemical weapons earlier this month is an assault on human dignity, the president said. a failure to respond with force, obama argued, could lead to escalating use of chemical weapons or their proliferation to terrorist groups who would do our people harm. in a world with many dangers, this menace must be confronted. syria missile strike what would happen next map u.s. and allied assets around syria obama decision came friday night on friday night, the president made a last minute decision to consult lawmakers. what will happen if they vote no it is unclear. a senior administration official told that obama has the authority to act without congress even if congress rejects his request for authorization to use force. obama on saturday continued to shore up support for a strike on the al assad government. he spoke by phone with french president francois hollande before his rose garden speech. the two leaders agreed that the international community must deliver a resolute message to the assad regime and others who would consider using chemical weapons that these crimes are unacceptable and those who violate this international norm will be held accountable by the world, the white house said. meanwhile, as uncertainty loomed over how congress would weigh in, u.s. military officials said they remained at the ready. 5 key assertions u.s. intelligence report on syria syria who wants what after chemical weapons horror reactions mixed to obama is speech a spokesman for the syrian national coalition said that the opposition group was disappointed by obama is announcement. our fear now is that the lack of action could embolden the regime and they repeat his attacks in a more serious way, said spokesman louay safi. so we are quite concerned. some members of congress applauded obama is decision. house speaker john boehner, majority leader eric cantor, majority whip kevin mccarthy and conference chair cathy mcmorris rodgers issued a statement saturday praising the president. under the constitution, the responsibility to declare war lies with congress, the republican lawmakers said. we are glad the president is seeking authorization for any military action in syria in response to serious, substantive questions being raised. more than 160 legislators, including 63 of obama is fellow democrats, had signed letters calling for either a vote or at least a full debate before any u.s. action. british prime minister david cameron, whose own attempt to get lawmakers in his country to support military action in syria failed earlier this week, responded to obama is speech in a twitter post saturday. i understand and support barack obama is position on syria, cameron said. an influential lawmaker in russia which has stood by syria and criticized the united states had his own theory. the main reason obama is turning to the congress the military operation did not get enough support either in the world, among allies of the us or in the united states itself, alexei pushkov, chairman of the international affairs committee of the russian state duma, said in a twitter post. in the united states, scattered groups of anti war protesters around the country took to the streets saturday. like many other americans...we are just tired of the united states getting involved and invading and bombing other countries, said robin rosecrans, who was among hundreds at a los angeles demonstration. what do syria is neighbors think why russia, china, iran stand by assad syria is government unfazed after obama is speech, a military and political analyst on syrian state tv said obama is embarrassed that russia opposes military action against syria, is crying for help for someone to come to his rescue and is facing two defeats on the political and military levels. syria is prime minister appeared unfazed by the saber rattling. the syrian army is status is on maximum readiness and fingers are on the trigger to confront all challenges, wael nader al halqi said during a meeting with a delegation of syrian expatriates from italy, according to a banner on syria state tv that was broadcast prior to obama is address. an anchor on syrian state television said obama appeared to be preparing for an aggression on syria based on repeated lies. a top syrian diplomat told the state television network that obama was facing pressure to take military action from israel, turkey, some arabs and right wing extremists in the united states. i think he has done well by doing what cameron did in terms of taking the issue to parliament, said bashar jaafari, syria is ambassador to the united nations. both obama and cameron, he said, climbed to the top of the tree and do not know how to get down. the syrian government has denied that it used chemical weapons in the august 21 attack, saying that jihadists fighting with the rebels used them in an effort to turn global sentiments against it. british intelligence had put the number of people killed in the attack at more than 350. on saturday, obama said all told, well over 1,000 people were murdered. u.s. secretary of state john kerry on friday cited a death toll of 1,429, more than 400 of them children. no explanation was offered for the discrepancy. iran u.s. military action in syria would spark wouldisaster opinion why strikes in syria are a bad idea \n",

charged clear of united states rival justin gatlin as the jamaican quartet of nesta carter, kemar bailey cole, nickel ashmeade and bolt won in 37.36 seconds. the u.s finished second in 37.56 seconds

american trio carl lewis, michael johnson and allyson felix, not to mention the small matter of six olympic titles. the relay triumph followed individual successes in the 100 and 200 meters in the russian capital. i am proud of myself and i will continue to work to dominate for as long as possible, bolt said, having previously expressed his intention to carry on until the 2016 rio olympics. victory was never seriously in doubt once he got the baton safely in hand from ashmeade, while gatlin and the united states third leg runner rakieem salaam had problems. gatlin strayed out of his lane as he struggled to get full control of their baton and was never able to get on terms with bolt. earlier, jamaica is women underlined their dominance in the sprint events by winning the 4x100m relay gold, anchored by shelly ann fraser pryce, who like bolt was completing a triple. their quartet recorded a championship record of 41.29 seconds, well clear of france, who crossed the line in second place in 42.73 seconds. defending champions, the united states, were initially back in the bronze medal position after losing time on the second handover between alexandria anderson and english gardner, but promoted to silver when france were subsequently disqualified for an illegal handover. the british quartet, who were initially fourth, were promoted to the bronze which eluded their men

dash for golden glory brought the eight day championship to a rousing finale, but while the hosts topped the medal table from the united states there was criticism of the poor attendances in the luzhniki stadium. there was further concern when their pole vault gold medalist yelena isinbayeva made controversial remarks in support of russia is new laws, which make the propagandizing of non traditional sexual relations among minors a criminal offense. she later attempted to clarify her comments, but there were renewed calls by gay rights groups for a boycott of the 2014 winter games in sochi, the next major sports event in russia.

       "2      kansas city, missouri the general services administration, already under investigation for lavish spending, allowed an employee to telecommute from hawaii even though he is based at the gsa is kansas city, missouri, office, a investigation has found. it cost more than 24,000 for the business development specialist to travel to and from the mainland united states over the past year. he is among several hundred gsa virtual workers who also travel to various conferences and their home offices, costing the agency millions of dollars over the past three years. under the program, employees work from home and may live in another state from the region in which they are actually assigned. the kansas city employee, who started his job in january 2011, is paid 84,440 and works from his home in honolulu, a gsa representative confirmed. in the past year, according to gsa travel records, the employee has flown back to the mainland nine times for conferences and meetings. four of those trips were to st. louis four were to washington, with a side trip to cincinnati and one was to san diego. the total cost to taxpayers was 24,221. jason klumb, the gsa is regional administrator for kansas city, defended the hire. the cost of that travel was included in the consideration of his candidacy as an employee as compared with the other applicants, klumb said. and when factoring all of those in, it was determined that he was the best candidate, even in light of the cost that would be incurred. klumb called the gsa is teleworking program a successful program that is going to lead to cost savings for taxpayers. but a gsa spokeswoman said, we are not going to defend this type of travel. and a gsa employee in kansas city, who requested anonymity, said that hiring someone in hawaii to work for the kansas city region was ludicrous. it does not make sense, the employee said. when you consider everything you need when you hire someone, it would have been better to look for someone in the kansas city area. it would have reduced the cost of travel by at least 70 percent when you look at just the airfare of what it takes to from honolulu to washington, d.c., where a lot of business is done. dan tangherlini, who was appointed acting gsa administrator this year, said the agency was examining the cost of the entire teleworking program. i think the most important part for the gsa to think about is make sure we open ourselves up, avail ourselves to all the smart people in the country, but then also make sure we have a clear business case, he said. if we have someone who is working in nebraska but reporting to boston, there has to be a clear explanation for what value they are providing, and you have got to give me the business case. you have got to explain to me why that is a cost effective move for the american people, and that is a new standard that we are asking everyone at gsa to adhere to. the gsa virtual employee program is different from telework programs offered by many private companies including is parent company, turner broadcasting, in which some employees are encouraged to work from home some days of the week, partially to reduce traffic congestion. the house committee on oversight and government reform requested details about the gsa is teleworking program in june. that followed disclosures that 95 virtual employees, including 12 in supervisory positions, spent nearly 750,000 in travel costs between october 2010 and june 2011. the american people have a right to know that federal bureaucrats who enjoy the benefits of virtual work are eligible and responsible stewards of the taxpayer dollars that support the program, according to a letter from committee chairman rep. darrell issa, r california, to the gsa. the details requested by issa about the gsa program have not been provided to the committee. also requested the information more than two months ago through the federal freedom of information act but has been repeatedly told by the gsa that foia staff members have not finished compiling the material. the general services administration, which has more than 12,600 employees and a 26.3 billion budget, is a relatively obscure federal agency that handles government real estate and other non military procurement. congress launched an investigation into the gsa after a scathing inspector general is report issued this year showed lavish spending 823,000 at the agency is western regions conference in las vegas in october 2010. the controversy became politically toxic after reports and video clips of the lavish conference were released. the revelation prompted taxpayer indignation, embarrassed the administration and put a spotlight on wasteful spending by the gsa. jeff neely, the gsa official who organized the conference, resigned, as did the agency is administrator, martha johnson. two of johnson is deputies were fired, and eight other employees left the agency. tangherlini, a former treasury department official, took over as acting gsa administrator. in addition to the las vegas conference, the gsa apparently spent 330,000 to relocate an employee from denver to hawaii and probably millions more on other employees over a two year period, according to a transcript of an interview with a gsa event planner. and 84 gsa employees, most of them supervisors or other senior staff all subjects of inspector general investigations are still collecting their bonuses, totaling more than 1 million in taxpayer money. in july, a investigation revealed that the gsa is kansas city office spent more than 20,000 to send employees to cooking classes to build team spirit. while the classes do not amount to a significant sum of money in the world of trillion dollar government budgets, insiders said it was part of the free spending culture that went on for years at the gsa is kansas city regional headquarters. gsa spokeswoman betsaida alcantara said in a statement this year that all the agency is practices are under a top down review. is sara anwar, elizabeth m. nunez and tom cohen contributed to this report. watch erin burnett weekdays 7pm et. for the latest from erin burnett

       "3      los angeles a medical doctor in vancouver, british columbia, said thursday that california arson suspect harry burkhart suffered from severe mental illness in 2010, when she examined him as part of a team of doctors. dr. blaga stancheva, a family physician and specialist in obstetrics, said both burkhart and his mother, dorothee, were her patients in vancouver while both were applying for refugee status in canada. i was asked to diagnose and treat harry to support a claim explaining why he was unable to show up in a small claims court case, stancheva told in a phone interview. she declined to cite the case or burkhart is role in it. stancheva said she and other doctors including a psychiatrist diagnosed burkhart with autism, severe anxiety, post traumatic stress disorder and depression. the diagnosis was spelled out in a letter she wrote for the small claims court case, stancheva said. stancheva, citing doctor patient confidentiality, would not elaborate further, nor would she identify the psychiatrist involved in the diagnosis. burkhart, a 24 year old german national, has been charged with 37 counts of arson following a string of 52 fires in los angeles. the charges are in connection with arson fires at 12 locations scattered through hollywood, west hollywood and sherman oaks, according to authorities. stancheva said the refugee applications by burkhart and his mother were denied by the canadian government, and she has not seen burkhart since early march of 2010. i was shocked and dismayed at what happened in los angeles, and it appears he was not being treated for his depression, she said. burkhart was in court on wednesday for a preliminary hearing. prosecutors said his rage against americans, triggered by his mother is arrest last week, motivated his campaign of terror with dozens of fires in hollywood and nearby communities. burkhart kept his eyes closed and remained limp during most of his hearing, requiring sheriff is deputies to hold him up. the district attorney called his courtroom behavior very bizarre. this defendant has engaged in a protracted campaign in which he has set, the people believe, upwards of 52 arson fires in what essentially amounts to a campaign of terror against this community, los angeles county deputy district attorney sean carney said. the people believe he has engaged in this conduct because he has a hatred for americans. carney told the court burkhart would flee the country if he was allowed out of jail on bond, but los angeles superior court judge upinder kalra said he had no choice but to set bail. to go free while awaiting trial, burkhart must post a 2.85 million bond and surrender his german passport. it was revealed that burkhart is also under investigation for arson and fraud in relation to a fire in neukirchen, near frankfurt, germany. the worst arson sprees in the city is history began last friday morning with a car fire in hollywood that spread to apartments above a garage, but no new fires have happened since burkhart was arrested monday, los angeles district attorney steve cooley said. no one was hurt in the fires, but property damage costs are likely to reach 3 million, authorities said. cooley called it almost attempted murder, because people were sleeping in apartments above where burkhart allegedly set cars on fire with incendiary devices placed under their engines. the criminal complaint filed wednesday also alleged that the fires were caused by use of a device designed to accelerate the fire, cooley said. if found true, the allegation could mean additional custody time for the defendant. in numerous instances, the cars were parked in carports, resulting in the fires spreading to the adjacent occupied apartment buildings, a sworn affidavit from a los angeles arson investigator said. the vast majority of these fires occurred late at night when the occupants of the apartment buildings were asleep. investigator edward nordskog is affidavit detailed burkhart is behavior a day before the fires began, when he was in a federal courtroom during extradition proceedings for his mother. while in the audience, the defendant burkhart began yelling in an angry manner, f k all americans. the defendant also attempted to communicate with his mother who was in custody. shortly thereafter, the defendant was ejected from the courtroom by deputy u.s. marshals, nordskog wrote. dorothee burkhart was arrested a day before on an international arrest warrant issued by a district court in frankfurt, germany, said federal court spokesman gunther meilinger. the 53 year old german woman is wanted on 16 counts of fraud and three counts of embezzlement, he said. the charges include an allegation that she failed to pay for a breast enhancement operation performed on her in 2004, meilinger said. most of the german charges, however, stem from phony real estate deals that dorothee burkhart allegedly conducted between 2000 and 2006. it is my opinion that the defendant is criminal spree was motivated by his rage against americans and that by setting these fires the defendant intended to harm and terrorize as many residents of the city and county of los angeles as possible, nordskog wrote. a search of burkhart is hollywood apartment found newspaper clippings about the los angeles fires and articles from germany reporting similar car fires in frankfurt, germany in september, 2011, the investigator said. it is my opinion based on my experience that it is highly likely the defendant has a history of setting arson fires in germany before he came to the united states, nordskog wrote. burkhart is mother is scheduled for another extradition hearing friday, while he is due back in court for arraignment on january 24. meanwhile, both burkharts are housed in a los angeles jail.

       "92574  washington a second grand jury is decision not to indict a white police officer in the death of an unarmed black man once again had ripple effects that quickly spread from the streets on new york city to reach the halls of capitol hill. the decision not to indict a new york city police officer in the chokehold death of eric garner, a black man who was suspected of illegally selling cigarettes, came just nine days after another grand jury decided not to indict a white police officer in ferguson, missouri in the death of black teenager michael brown. the news led to another night of protests in major cities nationwide, including washington, d.c. president barack obama vowed not to let up in his efforts to ease racial tensions, and some democrats tried to channel demonstrators outrage in their reactions overnight and into thursday morning. and it was a rare development that brought members of both parties together in calling for further investigation. rep. cathy mcmorris rodgers, chairwoman of the house republican conference, said thursday morning that the house should absolutely hold hearings to investigate garner is death. we all have a lot of serious questions that need to be addressed and we need to understand what happened, why this decision was made, mcmorris rodgers said on msnbc is morning joe. i would call for the house to have those hearings so that we can better understand. but we need to take action, appropriate action, making sure our local law enforcement have the training, that they are using appropriate force, which i think we all recognize these are tragedies and it has raised a lot of questions. referring to rodgers call for hearings, house speaker john boehner said he would not rule that in or out, but said there are a lot of unanswered questions that americans have, and frankly i have. i do think that the american people deserve more answers about what really happened here and was our system of justice handled properly, boehner said thursday during a press conference. black leaders in congress quickly slammed the decision not to indict new york city police officer daniel pantaleo in garner is death and called on the department of justice to investigate garner is death. rep. marcia fudge, chairwoman of the congressional black caucus, said wednesday she was deeply disappointed in the decision not to indict pantaleo in garner is death and called the grand jury is decision yet another sad day for our country and our democracy. in the span of two weeks, this nation seems to have heard one message loud and clear there will be no accountability for taking black lives. as an american, it is growing increasingly difficult to believe that there is justice for all, she said in a statement. black lives do matter and our lives do hold value. rep. hakeem jeffries, the black caucus incoming whip who represents parts of new york city, called the grand jury is decision a stunning miscarriage of justice in a statement wednesday and said the decision makes clear that equal protection under the law does not exist for all americans. and jeffries said thursday that the incidents should serve as a catalyst for a wide shakeup in how cases involving police misconduct and potential crimes should be prosecuted. we need to look at broader reform and whether these type of cases should be handled by independent, special prosecutors so that we can have some measure of fairness and a real full and fair investigation, jeffries said on is new day. jeffries called the altercation between garner and the police officer, which was caught on video, a living breathing example of probable cause to indict. nearly a dozen times, garner tries telling the officer that he can not breathe and jeffries noted that garner even put his hands up in the air, but pantaleo continued to choke him. protests featuring slogans like hands up, do not shoot, black lives matter and now i can not breathe broke out again wednesday in reaction to the staten island grand jury is decision as demonstrators called for justice for garner and brown, the black teenager who was shot by police officer darren wilson in ferguson this summer. amid outcry from democrats on capitol hill and mostly silence from congressional republicans, two new york gop congressman defended the grand jury is decision wednesday not to indict nypd officer pantaleo. rep. peter king thanked the grand jury on twitter for doing justice and said later on that he felt strongly the police officer should not have been indicted. related rep. peter king thanks staten island grand jury for wouldoing justice rep. michael grimm, who represents staten island in congress, called the grand jury decision fair and reasoned in a statement wednesday and thanked the district attorney in the incident for handling the grand jury case with the utmost integrity. staten island is new york is whitest burrough and a majority of the grand jurors in the case were white. grimm did not fare so well at the hands of another grand jury last spring, when he was indicted on tax and other fraud charges. u.s. attorney general eric holder heeded calls from congressional leaders to launch a federal investigation and later wednesday formally announced that the justice department is leading a civil rights investigation into garner is death. president obama had also weighed in wednesday saying he had spoken with holder and said we are not going to let up until we see a strengthening of the trust and a strengthening of accountability that exists between our communities and law enforcement. holder is announcement came after sen. kirsten gillibrand of new york joined members of the congressional black caucus in calling on the justice department to investigate the staten island death. sen. kirsten gillibrand called the decision shocking and called garner is death a tragedy that demands accountability. nobody unarmed should die on a new york city street corner for suspected low level offenses, she said in a statement. u.s. attorney loretta lynch, obama is nominee to succeed holder as u.s. attorney general, will lead the investigation into garner is death. sen. chuck schumer, also of new york, said he was confident lynch will conduct a tough but fair investigation into the tragic death of eric garner. sen. rand paul, a kentucky republican and would be 2016 presidential contender who has specialized in reaching out to minority voters, blamed high taxes on cigarettes in the empire state as partially to blame for putting police officers in a dangerous situation with bad laws. .

       "92575  los angeles california gov. jerry brown will seek an immediate stay of what he called an unprecedented federal court order to release almost 10,000 inmates to relieve prison overcrowding by the end of the year, he said thursday. a three judge federal court panel ordered the state to reduce its prison population to 137.5 of design capacity by december 31 and threatened to find the state in contempt if california does not report on its progress every two weeks, thursday is ruling said. california has the nation is largest prison system and says it has been reducing overcrowding. the case grows out of lawsuits filed in 1990 and 2001 that alleged overcrowding is at the core of a domino effect of unsafe and unhealthy conditions for those on both sides of the iron bars. when plaintiffs filed motions to convene the three judge court panel in november 2006, california is prisons were at 202 of design capacity. in 2011, the u.s. supreme court upheld a three judge federal panel is determination that california is medical and mental health care for inmates falls below a constitutional level of care and that the only way to meet the requirements is by reducing prison crowding. the supreme court in 2011 found that california is shortcomings in prison medical and mental health care resulted in needless suffering and death and recognized the federal court is prison reduction order was of unprecedented sweep and extent, thursday is ruling said. the high court affirmed that order in full in 2011. on thursday, the three u.s. district court judges expressed impatience with california officials, the defendants in the case. the history of this litigation is of defendants repeated failure to take the necessary steps to remedy the constitutional violations in its prison system, the order said. it is defendants unwillingness to comply with this court is orders that requires us to order additional relief today. the three judge panel added that the plaintiffs request for a court order to show why california should not be held in contempt has considerable merit. our first priority, however, is to eliminate the deprivation of constitutional liberties in the california prison system, the three judges said in their ruling. we will therefore defer ruling on plaintiffs motion, and defer instituting any contempt proceedings related to defendants prior acts until after we are able to determine whether defendants will comply with this order. court documents also show that defer was not only all capitalized but also printed in bold face.

       "92576  norfolk, virginia the second mate of the houston express probably could not believe what he was seeing. hundreds of miles from land there was a small boat nearby. at first it looked abandoned. it was in bad shape, listing to one side. the crew of the 1,000 foot long container ship thought it was a yacht that had wrecked. incredibly, as they got closer, they saw there was a man on it, signaling for help. he was moving, walking around, waving to us and in surprisingly good condition, capt. thomas grenz told by phone friday. that man, louis jordan, 37, had an amazing story. he would been drifting on the 35 foot pearson sailboat for more than two months since leaving conway, south carolina, to fish in the ocean. just a few days into his trip, a storm capsized his boat and broke his mast. one of his shoulders was broken, too, so he could not fix the boat right away. eventually he was able to rig a makeshift mast and sail, but he could make little headway against the currents. it took so long, jordan said. it moved so slowly. the boat capsized two more times before he was rescued, according to jordan. his father, frank jordan, told is jim sciutto that he was expecting his son to look different. he looked good. had not lost too much weight. he was not badly sunburned like i thought he probably would be, he said. lost at sea for 66 days after his food and water ran out, it became an issue of survival. collecting fresh water was a nightmare for jordan. the weather would not cooperate. records show there were more than a dozen storms off the coast of the carolinas during the time he was missing. the precipitation came at night during harsh conditions. i had tried to collect rain water ... but every time the waves would splash into the boat, jordan said. the waves would put saltwater into my freshwater and it tasted bad. finally the conditions were right. i filled up my water tank, which is 25 gallons. i filled up a bucket. then there was the issue of food. the fish were not cooperating, but after a while jordan learned they were attracted to his laundry, which he would put out to sea for a rinse. the fish would swim in and out of his clothes and he could easily scoop them up with a hand net, he said. jordan came ashore thursday evening. affiliate wavy in norfolk, virginia, reported that he was able to walk from the helicopter into sentara norfolk general hospital about 7 30 p.m. coast guard officials have said they have found no reason to doubt jordan is incredible story. they noted that his father contacted them january 29 to report his son and his boat missing. frank jordan addressed the skepticism about his son is appearance, saying the boat stayed afloat and upright most of the time. his son spent most of his days in the cabin, out of the sun. frank jordan said it was obvious when the jordans met at the hospital friday morning that his normally low key and private son had been through an ordeal. i know he went through what he went through, frank jordan said. jordan is an unemployed truck driver who lived on his boat at a marina in conway. he had free rent and free food in the river, he said. but when it became difficult to catch dinner, he took off for the ocean in hopes he would land some bigger fish. frank jordan told is wolf blitzer on thursday that he had worried about his son, who is an inexperienced sailor, but he held hope because his son had a good boat. and he had the strength to make it. he is got a very strong constitution and is strong not only physically, but spiritually, frank jordan said. and he told me on the phone that he was praying the whole time, so i believe that sustained him a great deal. rescue swimmer kyle mccollum was the first to care for jordan on the flight back to land. you would expect sunburns, severe sunburn, blisters maybe ... a bunch of medical issues that could possibly be wrong with him, he said. but for him to be in his current state was pretty amazing. grenz was also surprised by jordan is condition, physically and mentally. the rescued sailor knew almost exactly what day it was, remarkable for someone who had been on the water for more than 60 days. jordan was dehydrated and said he was hungry. we took him to a rescue boat, the container ship captain said. he was given water and pea soup to gain some power again. derriel morris, a neighbor at the bucksport plantation marina rv resort called jordan a nice guy who loved his 47 year old boat, named angel. morris said it was immaculate, it was gorgeous, beautifully painted. i mean it looked like a brand new sailboat. morris told affiliate wpde that one day in january he was going to the store and jordan asked him to bring back some coffee creamer. but when he returned to the marina, jordan had slipped away. there was no shore line, no hose it was like he was never there, morris told the station. after he disappeared others who also live there held a candlelight ceremony. the marina is manager, jeff weeks, told wpde that jordan is expected to be back at buscksport next week. tales of people who cheated death after days, weeks adrift

welcome to student news first up u.n. general assembly azuz first up, leaders from around the world are coming together for a meeting in new york city. it is the united nations general assembly, and it gets together every year. the group is going to talk about world issues different leaders will make speeches. president obama is scheduled to address the assembly today. so what why does it matter that a bunch of leaders are having a meeting well, the united nations general assembly is made up of 192 countries. and when we say they are talking about world issues, we mean big subjects, like

with can have a big influence on what goes on in the world. health care provisions azuz in the health care reform bill that you see president obama signing over my shoulder here, that might have been his biggest victory of his first two years in office. and parts of that law go into effect this week. for example, you can stay on your parents health insurance until you are 26, and insurance

jobs and make the shift into the private sector. begin video shasta darlington, correspondent, havana a tall order in communist cuba finding jobs for half a million laid off workers in the private sector. here in old havana, not everyone is celebrating this capitalist notion. like it or not, employees at this barbershop around the corner are being pushed off the state payroll and handed the shop. they will be able to set prices and keep earnings, but they will now have to pay taxes and rent, and there is no longer the guarantee of a fixed income. gerardo, havana barber translated i have been working for the state for years now and i am not interested in going private, says gerardo. i want to keep working for the state. darlington cuba plans to shed ten percent of public sector jobs over the next six months and allow more private enterprise to absorb the unemployed. a dramatic attempt by president raul castro to reshape the sputtering economy. he says the state simply can not

       "      <td>it is official u.s. president barack obama wants lawmakers to weigh in on whether to use military force in syria. obama sent a letter to the heads of the house and senate on saturday night, hours after announcing that he believes military action against syrian targets is the right step to take over the alleged use of chemical weapons. the proposed legislation from obama asks congress to approve the use of military force to deter, disrupt, prevent and degrade the potential for future uses of chemical weapons or other weapons of mass destruction. it is a step that is set to turn an international crisis into a fierce domestic political battle. there are key questions looming over the debate what did u.n. weapons inspectors find in syria what happens if congress votes no and how will the syrian government react in a televised address from the white house rose garden earlier saturday, the president said he would take his case to congress, not because he has to but because he wants to. while i believe i have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, i know that the country will be stronger if we take this course, and our actions will be even more effective, he said. we should have this debate, because the issues are too big for business as usual. obama said top congressional leaders had agreed to schedule a debate when the body returns to washington on september 9. the senate foreign relations committee will hold a hearing over the matter on tuesday, sen. robert menendez said. transcript read obama is full remarks syrian crisis latest developments u.n. inspectors leave syria obama is remarks came shortly after u.n. inspectors left syria, carrying evidence that will determine whether chemical weapons were used in an attack early last week in a damascus suburb. the aim of the game here, the mandate, is very clear and that is to ascertain whether chemical weapons were used and not by whom, u.n. spokesman martin nesirky told reporters on saturday. but who used the weapons in the reported toxic gas attack in a damascus suburb on august 21 has been a key point of global debate over the syrian crisis. top u.s. officials have said there is no doubt that the syrian government was behind it, while syrian officials have denied responsibility and blamed jihadists fighting with the rebels. british and u.s. intelligence reports say the attack involved chemical weapons, but u.n. officials have stressed the importance of waiting for an official report from inspectors. the inspectors will share their findings with u.n. secretary general ban ki moon ban, who has said he wants to wait until the u.n. team is final report is completed before presenting it to the u.n. security council. the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons, which nine of the inspectors belong to, said saturday that it could take up to three weeks to analyze the evidence they collected. it needs time to be able to analyze the information and the samples, nesirky said. he noted that ban has repeatedly said there is no alternative to a political solution to the crisis in syria, and that a military solution is not an option. bergen syria is a problem from hell for the u.s. obama this menace must be confronted obama is senior advisers have debated the next steps to take, and the president is comments saturday came amid mounting political pressure over the situation in syria. some u.s. lawmakers have called for immediate action while others warn of stepping into what could become a quagmire. some global leaders have expressed support, but the british parliament is vote against military action earlier this week was a blow to obama is hopes of getting strong backing from key nato allies. on saturday, obama proposed what he said would be a limited military action against syrian president bashar al assad. any military attack would not be open ended or include u.s. ground forces, he said. syria is alleged use of chemical weapons earlier this month is an assault on human dignity, the president said. a failure to respond with force, obama argued, could lead to escalating use of chemical weapons or their proliferation to terrorist groups who would do our people harm. in a world with many dangers, this menace must be confronted. syria missile strike what would happen next map u.s. and allied assets around syria obama decision came friday night on friday night, the president made a last minute decision to consult lawmakers. what will happen if they vote no it is unclear. a senior administration official told that obama has the authority to act without congress even if congress rejects his request for authorization to use force. obama on saturday continued to shore up support for a strike on the al assad government. he spoke by phone with french president francois hollande before his rose garden speech. the two leaders agreed that the international community must deliver a resolute message to the assad regime and others who would consider using chemical weapons that these crimes are unacceptable and those who violate this international norm will be held accountable by the world, the white house said. meanwhile, as uncertainty loomed over how congress would weigh in, u.s. military officials said they remained at the ready. 5 key assertions u.s. intelligence report on syria syria who wants what after chemical weapons horror reactions mixed to obama is speech a spokesman for the syrian national coalition said that the opposition group was disappointed by obama is announcement. our fear now is that the lack of action could embolden the regime and they repeat his attacks in a more serious way, said spokesman louay safi. so we are quite concerned. some members of congress applauded obama is decision. house speaker john boehner, majority leader eric cantor, majority whip kevin mccarthy and conference chair cathy mcmorris rodgers issued a statement saturday praising the president. under the constitution, the responsibility to declare war lies with congress, the republican lawmakers said. we are glad the president is seeking authorization for any military action in syria in response to serious, substantive questions being raised. more than 160 legislators, including 63 of obama is fellow democrats, had signed letters calling for either a vote or at least a full debate before any u.s. action. british prime minister david cameron, whose own attempt to get lawmakers in his country to support military action in syria failed earlier this week, responded to obama is speech in a twitter post saturday. i understand and support barack obama is position on syria, cameron said. an influential lawmaker in russia which has stood by syria and criticized the united states had his own theory. the main reason obama is turning to the congress the military operation did not get enough support either in the world, among allies of the us or in the united states itself, alexei pushkov, chairman of the international affairs committee of the russian state duma, said in a twitter post. in the united states, scattered groups of anti war protesters around the country took to the streets saturday. like many other americans...we are just tired of the united states getting involved and invading and bombing other countries, said robin rosecrans, who was among hundreds at a los angeles demonstration. what do syria is neighbors think why russia, china, iran stand by assad syria is government unfazed after obama is speech, a military and political analyst on syrian state tv said obama is embarrassed that russia opposes military action against syria, is crying for help for someone to come to his rescue and is facing two defeats on the political and military levels. syria is prime minister appeared unfazed by the saber rattling. the syrian army is status is on maximum readiness and fingers are on the trigger to confront all challenges, wael nader al halqi said during a meeting with a delegation of syrian expatriates from italy, according to a banner on syria state tv that was broadcast prior to obama is address. an anchor on syrian state television said obama appeared to be preparing for an aggression on syria based on repeated lies. a top syrian diplomat told the state television network that obama was facing pressure to take military action from israel, turkey, some arabs and right wing extremists in the united states. i think he has done well by doing what cameron did in terms of taking the issue to parliament, said bashar jaafari, syria is ambassador to the united nations. both obama and cameron, he said, climbed to the top of the tree and do not know how to get down. the syrian government has denied that it used chemical weapons in the august 21 attack, saying that jihadists fighting with the rebels used them in an effort to turn global sentiments against it. british intelligence had put the number of people killed in the attack at more than 350. on saturday, obama said all told, well over 1,000 people were murdered. u.s. secretary of state john kerry on friday cited a death toll of 1,429, more than 400 of them children. no explanation was offered for the discrepancy. iran u.s. military action in syria would spark wouldisaster opinion

       "      <td>kansas city, missouri the general services administration, already under investigation for lavish spending, allowed an employee to telecommute from hawaii even though he is based at the gsa is kansas city, missouri, office, a investigation has found. it cost more than 24,000 for the business development specialist to travel to and from the mainland united states over the past year. he is among several hundred gsa virtual workers who also travel to various conferences and their home offices, costing the agency millions of dollars over the past three years. under the program, employees work from home and may live in another state from the region in which they are actually assigned. the kansas city employee, who started his job in january 2011, is paid 84,440 and works from his home in honolulu, a gsa representative confirmed. in the past year, according to gsa travel records, the employee has flown back to the mainland nine times for conferences and meetings. four of those trips were to st. louis four were to washington, with a side trip to cincinnati and one was to san diego. the total cost to taxpayers was 24,221. jason klumb, the gsa is regional administrator for kansas city, defended the hire. the cost of that travel was included in the consideration of his candidacy as an employee as compared with the other applicants, klumb said. and when factoring all of those in, it was determined that he was the best candidate, even in light of the cost that would be incurred. klumb called the gsa is teleworking program a successful program that is going to lead to cost savings for taxpayers. but a gsa spokeswoman said, we are not going to defend this type of travel. and a gsa employee in kansas city, who requested anonymity, said that hiring someone in hawaii to work for the kansas city region was ludicrous. it does not make sense, the employee said. when you consider everything you need when you hire someone, it would have been better to look for someone in the kansas city area. it would have reduced the cost of travel by at least 70 percent when you look at just the airfare of what it takes to from honolulu to washington, d.c., where a lot of business is done. dan tangherlini, who was appointed acting gsa administrator this year, said the agency was examining the cost of the entire teleworking program. i think the most important part for the gsa to think about is make sure we open ourselves up, avail ourselves to all the smart people in the country, but then also make sure we have a clear business case, he said. if we have someone who is working in nebraska but reporting to boston, there has to be a clear explanation for what value they are providing, and you have got to give me the business case. you have got to explain to me why that is a cost effective move for the american people, and that is a new standard that we are asking everyone at gsa to adhere to. the gsa virtual employee program is different from telework programs offered by many private companies including is parent company, turner broadcasting, in which some employees are encouraged to work from home some days of the week, partially to reduce traffic congestion. the house committee on oversight and government reform requested details about the gsa is teleworking program in june. that followed disclosures that 95 virtual employees, including 12 in supervisory positions, spent nearly 750,000 in travel costs between october 2010 and june 2011. the american people have a right to know that federal bureaucrats who enjoy the benefits of virtual work are eligible and responsible stewards of the taxpayer dollars that support the program, according to a letter from committee chairman rep. darrell issa, r california, to the gsa. the details requested by issa about the gsa program have not been provided to the committee. also requested the information more than two months ago through the federal freedom of information act but has been repeatedly told by the gsa that foia staff members have not finished compiling the material. the general services administration, which has more than 12,600 employees and a 26.3 billion budget, is a relatively obscure federal agency that handles government real estate and other non military procurement. congress launched an investigation into the gsa after a scathing inspector general is report issued this year showed lavish spending 823,000 at the agency is western regions conference in las vegas in october 2010. the controversy became politically toxic after reports and video clips of the lavish conference were released. the revelation prompted taxpayer indignation, embarrassed the administration and put a spotlight on wasteful spending by the gsa. jeff neely, the gsa official who organized the conference, resigned, as did the agency is administrator, martha johnson. two of johnson is deputies were fired, and eight other employees left the agency. tangherlini, a former treasury department official, took over as acting gsa administrator. in addition to the las vegas conference, the gsa apparently spent 330,000 to relocate an employee from denver to hawaii and probably millions more on other employees over a two year period, according to a transcript of an interview with a gsa event planner. and 84 gsa employees, most of them supervisors or other senior staff all subjects of inspector general investigations are still collecting their bonuses, totaling more than 1 million in taxpayer money. in july, a investigation revealed that the gsa is kansas city office spent more than 20,000 to send employees to cooking classes to build team spirit. while the classes do not amount to a significant sum of money in the world of trillion dollar government budgets, insiders said it was part of the free spending culture that went on for years at the gsa is kansas city regional headquarters. gsa spokeswoman betsaida alcantara said in a statement this year that all the agency is practices are under a top down review. is sara anwar, elizabeth m. nunez and tom cohen contributed to this report. watch erin burnett weekdays 7pm et. for the latest from erin

       "      <td>los angeles a medical doctor in vancouver, british columbia, said thursday that california arson suspect harry burkhart suffered from severe mental illness in 2010, when she examined him as part of a team of doctors. dr. blaga stancheva, a family physician and specialist in obstetrics, said both burkhart and his mother, dorothee, were her patients in vancouver while both were applying for refugee status in canada. i was asked to diagnose and treat harry to support a claim explaining why he was unable to show up in a small claims court case, stancheva told in a phone interview. she declined to cite the case or burkhart is role in it. stancheva said she and other doctors including a psychiatrist diagnosed burkhart with autism, severe anxiety, post traumatic stress disorder and depression. the diagnosis was spelled out in a letter she wrote for the small claims court case, stancheva said. stancheva, citing doctor patient confidentiality, would not elaborate further, nor would she identify the psychiatrist involved in the diagnosis. burkhart, a 24 year old german national, has been charged with 37 counts of arson following a string of 52 fires in los angeles. the charges are in connection with arson fires at 12 locations scattered through hollywood, west hollywood and sherman oaks, according to authorities. stancheva said the refugee applications by burkhart and his mother were denied by the canadian government, and she has not seen burkhart since early march of 2010. i was shocked and dismayed at what happened in los angeles, and it appears he was not being treated for his depression, she said. burkhart was in court on wednesday for a preliminary hearing. prosecutors said his rage against americans, triggered by his mother is arrest last week, motivated his campaign of terror with dozens of fires in hollywood and nearby communities. burkhart kept his eyes closed and remained limp during most of his hearing, requiring sheriff is deputies to hold him up. the district attorney called his courtroom behavior very bizarre. this defendant has engaged in a protracted campaign in which he has set, the people believe, upwards of 52 arson fires in what essentially amounts to a campaign of terror against this community, los angeles county deputy district attorney sean carney said. the people believe he has engaged in this conduct because he has a hatred for americans. carney told the court burkhart would flee the country if he was allowed out of jail on bond, but los angeles superior court judge upinder kalra said he had no choice but to set bail. to go free while awaiting trial, burkhart must post a 2.85 million bond and surrender his german passport. it was revealed that burkhart is also under investigation for arson and fraud in relation to a fire in neukirchen, near frankfurt, germany. the worst arson sprees in the city is history began last friday morning with a car fire in hollywood that spread to apartments above a garage, but no new fires have happened since burkhart was arrested monday, los angeles district attorney steve cooley said. no one was hurt in the fires, but property damage costs are likely to reach 3 million, authorities said. cooley called it almost attempted murder, because people were sleeping in apartments above where burkhart allegedly set cars on fire with incendiary devices placed under their engines. the criminal complaint filed wednesday also alleged that the fires were caused by use of a device designed to accelerate the fire, cooley said. if found true, the allegation could mean additional custody time for the defendant. in numerous instances, the cars were parked in carports, resulting in the fires spreading to the adjacent occupied apartment buildings, a sworn affidavit from a los angeles arson investigator said. the vast majority of these fires occurred late at night when the occupants of the apartment buildings were asleep. investigator edward nordskog is affidavit detailed burkhart is behavior a day before the fires began, when he was in a federal courtroom during extradition proceedings for his mother. while in the audience, the defendant burkhart began yelling in an angry manner, f k all americans. the defendant also attempted to communicate with his mother who was in custody. shortly thereafter, the defendant was ejected from the courtroom by deputy u.s. marshals, nordskog wrote. dorothee burkhart was arrested a day before on an international arrest warrant issued by a district court in frankfurt, germany, said federal court spokesman gunther meilinger. the 53 year old german woman is wanted on 16 counts of fraud and three counts of embezzlement, he said. the charges include an allegation that she failed to pay for a breast enhancement operation performed on her in 2004, meilinger said. most of the german charges, however, stem from phony real estate deals that dorothee burkhart allegedly conducted between 2000 and 2006. it is my opinion that the defendant is criminal spree was motivated by his rage against americans and that by setting these fires the defendant intended to harm and terrorize as many residents of the city and county of los angeles as possible, nordskog wrote. a search of burkhart is hollywood apartment found newspaper clippings about the los angeles fires and articles from germany reporting similar car fires in frankfurt, germany in september, 2011, the investigator said. it is my opinion based on my experience that it is highly likely the defendant has a history of setting arson fires in germany before he came to the united states, nordskog wrote. burkhart is mother is scheduled for another extradition hearing friday, while he is due back in court for arraignment on january 24. meanwhile, both burkharts are housed in a los angeles jail.</td>\n",

demonstrators outrage in their reactions overnight and into thursday morning. and it was a rare development that brought members of both parties together in calling for further investigation. rep.

indict pantaleo in garner is death and called the grand jury is decision yet another sad day for our country and our democracy. in the span of two weeks, this nation seems to have heard one message loud and clear there will be no accountability for taking black lives. as an american, it is growing increasingly difficult to believe that there is justice for all, she said in a statement. black lives do matter and our lives do hold value. rep. hakeem jeffries, the black caucus incoming whip who represents parts of new york city, called the grand jury is decision a stunning miscarriage of justice in a statement wednesday and said the decision makes clear that equal protection under the law does not exist for all americans. and jeffries said thursday that the incidents should serve as a catalyst for a wide shakeup in how cases involving police misconduct and potential crimes should be prosecuted. we need to look at broader reform and whether these type of cases should be handled by independent, special prosecutors so that we can have some measure of fairness and a real full and fair investigation, jeffries said on is new day. jeffries called the altercation between garner and the police officer, which was caught on video, a living breathing example of probable cause to indict. nearly a dozen times, garner tries telling the officer that he can not breathe and jeffries noted that garner even put his hands up in the air, but pantaleo continued to choke him. protests featuring slogans like hands up, do not shoot, black lives matter and now i can not breathe broke out again wednesday in reaction to the staten island grand jury is decision as demonstrators called for justice for garner and brown, the black teenager who was shot by police officer darren wilson in ferguson this summer. amid outcry from democrats on capitol hill and mostly silence from congressional republicans, two new york gop congressman defended the grand jury is decision wednesday not to indict nypd officer pantaleo. rep. peter king thanked the grand jury on twitter for doing justice and said later on that he felt strongly the police officer should not have been indicted. related rep. peter king thanks staten island grand jury for wouldoing justice rep. michael grimm, who represents staten island in congress, called the grand jury decision fair and reasoned in a statement wednesday and thanked the district attorney in the incident for handling the grand jury case with the utmost integrity. staten island is new york is whitest burrough and a majority of the grand jurors in the case were white. grimm did not fare so well at the hands of another grand jury last spring, when he was indicted on tax and other fraud charges. u.s. attorney general eric holder heeded calls from congressional leaders to launch a federal investigation and later wednesday formally announced that the justice department is leading a civil rights investigation into garner is death. president obama had also weighed in wednesday saying he had spoken with holder and said we are not going to let up until we see a strengthening of the trust and a strengthening of accountability that exists between our communities and law enforcement. holder is announcement came after sen. kirsten gillibrand of new york joined members of the congressional black caucus in calling on the justice department to investigate the staten island death. sen. kirsten gillibrand called the decision shocking and called garner is death a tragedy that demands accountability. nobody unarmed should die on a new york city street corner for suspected low level offenses, she said in a statement. u.s. attorney loretta lynch, obama is nominee to succeed holder as u.s. attorney general, will lead the investigation into garner is death. sen. chuck schumer, also of new york, said he was confident lynch will conduct a tough but fair investigation into the tragic death of eric garner. sen. rand paul, a kentucky republican and would be 2016 presidential contender who has specialized in reaching out to minority voters, blamed high taxes on cigarettes in the empire state as partially to blame for putting police officers in a dangerous situation with bad laws. .</td>\n",

       "      <td>los angeles california gov. jerry brown will seek an immediate stay of what he called an unprecedented federal court order to release almost 10,000 inmates to relieve prison overcrowding by the end of the year, he said thursday. a three judge federal court panel ordered the state to reduce its prison population to 137.5 of design capacity by december 31 and threatened to find the state in contempt if california does not report on its progress every two weeks, thursday is ruling said. california has the nation is largest prison system and says it has been reducing overcrowding. the case grows out of lawsuits filed in 1990 and 2001 that alleged overcrowding is at the core of a domino effect of unsafe and unhealthy conditions for those on both sides of the iron bars. when plaintiffs filed motions to convene the three judge court panel in november 2006, california is prisons were at 202 of design capacity. in 2011, the u.s. supreme court upheld a three judge federal panel is determination that california is medical and mental health care for inmates falls below a constitutional level of care and that the only way to meet the requirements is by reducing prison crowding. the supreme court in 2011 found that california is shortcomings in prison medical and mental health care resulted in needless suffering and death and recognized the federal court is prison reduction order was of unprecedented sweep and extent, thursday is ruling said. the high court affirmed that order in full in 2011. on thursday, the three u.s. district court judges expressed impatience with california officials, the defendants in the case. the history of this litigation is of defendants repeated failure to take the necessary steps to remedy the constitutional violations in its prison system, the order said. it is defendants unwillingness to comply with this court is orders that requires us to order additional relief today. the three judge panel added that the plaintiffs request for a court order to show why california should not be held in contempt has considerable merit. our first priority, however, is to eliminate the deprivation of constitutional liberties in the california prison system, the three judges said in their ruling. we will therefore defer ruling on plaintiffs motion, and defer instituting any contempt proceedings related to defendants prior acts until after we are able to determine whether defendants will comply with this order. court documents also show that defer was not only all capitalized but also printed in bold face.</td>\n",

       "      <td>norfolk, virginia the second mate of the houston express probably could not believe what he was seeing. hundreds of miles from land there was a small boat nearby. at first it looked abandoned. it was in bad shape, listing to one side. the crew of the 1,000 foot long container ship thought it was a yacht that had wrecked. incredibly, as they got closer, they saw there was a man on it, signaling for help. he was moving, walking around, waving to us and in surprisingly good condition, capt. thomas grenz told by phone friday. that man, louis jordan, 37, had an amazing story. he would been drifting on the 35 foot pearson sailboat for more than two months since leaving conway, south carolina, to fish in the ocean. just a few days into his trip, a storm capsized his boat and broke his mast. one of his shoulders was broken, too, so he could not fix the boat right away. eventually he was able to rig a makeshift mast and sail, but he could make little headway against the currents. it took so long, jordan said. it moved so slowly. the boat capsized two more times before he was rescued, according to jordan. his father, frank jordan, told is jim sciutto that he was expecting his son to look different. he looked good. had not lost too much weight. he was not badly sunburned like i thought he probably would be, he said. lost at sea for 66 days after his food and water ran out, it became an issue of survival. collecting fresh water was a nightmare for jordan. the weather would not cooperate. records show there were more than a dozen storms off the coast of the carolinas during the time he was missing. the precipitation came at night during harsh conditions. i had tried to collect rain water ... but every time the waves would splash into the boat, jordan said. the waves would put saltwater into my freshwater and it tasted bad. finally the conditions were right. i filled up my water tank, which is 25 gallons. i filled up a bucket. then there was the issue of food. the fish were not cooperating, but after a while jordan learned they were attracted to his laundry, which he would put out to sea for a rinse. the fish would swim in and out of his clothes and he could easily scoop them up with a hand net, he said. jordan came ashore thursday evening. affiliate wavy in norfolk, virginia, reported that he was able to walk from the helicopter into sentara norfolk general hospital about 7 30 p.m. coast guard officials have said they have found no reason to doubt jordan is incredible story. they noted that his father contacted them january 29 to report his son and his boat missing. frank jordan addressed the skepticism about his son is appearance, saying the boat stayed afloat and upright most of the time. his son spent most of his days in the cabin, out of the sun. frank jordan said it was obvious when the jordans met at the hospital friday morning that his normally low key and private son had been through an ordeal. i know he went through what he went through, frank jordan said. jordan is an unemployed truck driver who lived on his boat at a marina in conway. he had free rent and free food in the river, he said. but when it became difficult to catch dinner, he took off for the ocean in hopes he would land some bigger fish. frank jordan told is wolf blitzer on thursday that he had worried about his son, who is an inexperienced sailor, but he held hope because his son had a good boat. and he had the strength to make it. he is got a very strong constitution and is strong not only physically, but spiritually, frank jordan said. and he told me on the phone that he was praying the whole time, so i believe that sustained him a great deal. rescue swimmer kyle mccollum was the first to care for jordan on the flight back to land. you would expect sunburns, severe sunburn, blisters maybe ... a bunch of medical issues that could possibly be wrong with him, he said. but for him to be in his current state was pretty amazing. grenz was also surprised by jordan is condition, physically and mentally. the rescued sailor knew almost exactly what day it was, remarkable for someone who had been on the water for more than 60 days. jordan was dehydrated and said he was hungry. we took him to a rescue boat, the container ship captain said. he was given water and pea soup to gain some power again. derriel morris, a neighbor at the bucksport plantation marina rv resort called jordan a nice guy who loved his 47 year old boat, named angel. morris said it was immaculate, it was gorgeous, beautifully painted. i mean it looked like a brand new sailboat. morris told affiliate wpde that one day in january he was going to the store and jordan asked him to bring back some coffee creamer. but when he returned to the marina, jordan had slipped away. there was no shore line, no hose it was like he was never there, morris told the station. after he disappeared others who also live there held a candlelight ceremony. the marina is manager, jeff weeks, told wpde that jordan is expected to be back at buscksport next week. tales of people who cheated death after days, weeks adrift</td>\n",

like poverty and security, and specific things, like the war in afghanistan or iran is nuclear program. they can not create new laws. but the decisions that they make and the policies that they come up with can have a big influence on what goes on in the world. health care provisions azuz in the health care reform bill that you see president obama signing over my shoulder here, that might have been his biggest victory of his first two years in office. and parts of that law go into effect this week. for example, you can stay on your parents health insurance until you are 26, and insurance companies can not turn down children with medical conditions that exist at the time they apply for insurance. some people were and still are against this law, though. for one thing, it can cost a lot of money. plus, critics do not like the idea that people have to get health insurance. that part of the bill goes into effect in a few years. what is the word tomeka jones, student news what is the

been working for the state for years now and i am not interested in going private, says gerardo. i want to keep working for the state. darlington cuba plans to shed ten percent of public sector jobs over the next six months and allow more private enterprise to absorb the unemployed. a dramatic attempt by president raul castro to reshape the sputtering economy. he says the state simply can not afford a bloated and unproductive workforce. but do not expect american style big business. cuba is new entrepreneurs will be encouraged to start small operations, maybe driving taxis, laying bricks

       "0      it is official u.s. president barack obama wants lawmakers to weigh in on whether to use military force in syria. obama sent a letter to the heads of the house and senate on saturday night, hours after announcing that he believes military action against syrian targets is the right step to take over the alleged use of chemical weapons. the proposed legislation from obama asks congress to approve the use of military force to deter, disrupt, prevent and degrade the potential for future uses of chemical weapons or other weapons of mass destruction. it is a step that is set to turn an international crisis into a fierce domestic political battle. there are key questions looming over the debate what did u.n. weapons inspectors find in syria what happens if congress votes no and how will the syrian government react in a televised address from the white house rose garden earlier saturday, the president said he would take his case to congress, not because he has to but because he wants to. while i believe i have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, i know that the country will be stronger if we take this course, and our actions will be even more effective, he said. we should have this debate, because the issues are too big for business as usual. obama said top congressional leaders had agreed to schedule a debate when the body returns to washington on september 9. the senate foreign relations committee will hold a hearing over the matter on tuesday, sen. robert menendez said. transcript read obama is full remarks syrian crisis latest developments u.n. inspectors leave syria obama is remarks came shortly after u.n. inspectors left syria, carrying evidence that will determine whether chemical weapons were used in an attack early last week in a damascus suburb. the aim of the game here, the mandate, is very clear and that is to ascertain whether chemical weapons were used and not by whom, u.n. spokesman martin nesirky told reporters on saturday. but who used the weapons in the reported toxic gas attack in a damascus suburb on august 21 has been a key point of global debate over the syrian crisis. top u.s. officials have said there is no doubt that the syrian government was behind it, while syrian officials have denied responsibility and blamed jihadists fighting with the rebels. british and u.s. intelligence reports say the attack involved chemical weapons, but u.n. officials have stressed the importance of waiting for an official report from inspectors. the inspectors will share their findings with u.n. secretary general ban ki moon ban, who has said he wants to wait until the u.n. team is final report is completed before presenting it to the u.n. security council. the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons, which nine of the inspectors belong to, said saturday that it could take up to three weeks to analyze the evidence they collected. it needs time to be able to analyze the information and the samples, nesirky said. he noted that ban has repeatedly said there is no alternative to a political solution to the crisis in syria, and that a military solution is not an option. bergen syria is a problem from hell for the u.s. obama this menace must be confronted obama is senior advisers have debated the next steps to take, and the president is comments saturday came amid mounting political pressure over the situation in syria. some u.s. lawmakers have called for immediate action while others warn of stepping into what could become a quagmire. some global leaders have expressed support, but the british parliament is vote against military action earlier this week was a blow to obama is hopes of getting strong backing from key nato allies. on saturday, obama proposed what he said would be a limited military action against syrian president bashar al assad. any military attack would not be open ended or include u.s. ground forces, he said. syria is alleged use of chemical weapons earlier this month is an assault on human dignity, the president said. a failure to respond with force, obama argued, could lead to escalating use of chemical weapons or their proliferation to terrorist groups who would do our people harm. in a world with many dangers, this menace must be confronted. syria missile strike what would happen next map u.s. and allied assets around syria obama decision came friday night on friday night, the president made a last minute decision to consult lawmakers. what will happen if they vote no it is unclear. a senior administration official told that obama has the authority to act without congress even if congress rejects his request for authorization to use force. obama on saturday continued to shore up support for a strike on the al assad government. he spoke by phone with french president francois hollande before his rose garden speech. the two leaders agreed that the international community must deliver a resolute message to the assad regime and others who would consider using chemical weapons that these crimes are unacceptable and those who violate this international norm will be held accountable by the world, the white house said. meanwhile, as uncertainty loomed over how congress would weigh in, u.s. military officials said they remained at the ready. 5 key assertions u.s. intelligence report on syria syria who wants what after chemical weapons horror reactions mixed to obama is speech a spokesman for the syrian national coalition said that the opposition group was disappointed by obama is announcement. our fear now is that the lack of action could embolden the regime and they repeat his attacks in a more serious way, said spokesman louay safi. so we are quite concerned. some members of congress applauded obama is decision. house speaker john boehner, majority leader eric cantor, majority whip kevin mccarthy and conference chair cathy mcmorris rodgers issued a statement saturday praising the president. under the constitution, the responsibility to declare war lies with congress, the republican lawmakers said. we are glad the president is seeking authorization for any military action in syria in response to serious, substantive questions being raised. more than 160 legislators, including 63 of obama is fellow democrats, had signed letters calling for either a vote or at least a full debate before any u.s. action. british prime minister david cameron, whose own attempt to get lawmakers in his country to support military action in syria failed earlier this week, responded to obama is speech in a twitter post saturday. i understand and support barack obama is position on syria, cameron said. an influential lawmaker in russia which has stood by syria and criticized the united states had his own theory. the main reason obama is turning to the congress the military operation did not get enough support either in the world, among allies of the us or in the united states itself, alexei pushkov, chairman of the international affairs committee of the russian state duma, said in a twitter post. in the united states, scattered groups of anti war protesters around the country took to the streets saturday. like many other americans...we are just tired of the united states getting involved and invading and bombing other countries, said robin rosecrans, who was among hundreds at a los angeles demonstration. what do syria is neighbors think why russia, china, iran stand by assad syria is government unfazed after obama is speech, a military and political analyst on syrian state tv said obama is embarrassed that russia opposes military action against syria, is crying for help for someone to come to his rescue and is facing two defeats on the political and military levels. syria is prime minister appeared unfazed by the saber rattling. the syrian army is status is on maximum readiness and fingers are on the trigger to confront all challenges, wael nader al halqi said during a meeting with a delegation of syrian expatriates from italy, according to a banner on syria state tv that was broadcast prior to obama is address. an anchor on syrian state television said obama appeared to be preparing for an aggression on syria based on repeated lies. a top syrian diplomat told the state television network that obama was facing pressure to take military action from israel, turkey, some arabs and right wing extremists in the united states. i think he has done well by doing what cameron did in terms of taking the issue to parliament, said bashar jaafari, syria is ambassador to the united nations. both obama and cameron, he said, climbed to the top of the tree and do not know how to get down. the syrian government has denied that it used chemical weapons in the august 21 attack, saying that jihadists fighting with the rebels used them in an effort to turn global sentiments against it. british intelligence had put the number of people killed in the attack at more than 350. on saturday, obama said all told, well over 1,000 people were murdered. u.s. secretary of state john kerry on friday cited a death toll of 1,429, more than 400 of them children. no explanation was offered for the discrepancy. iran u.s. military action in syria would spark wouldisaster opinion why strikes in syria are a bad idea    \n",
       "1       usain bolt rounded off the world championships sunday by claiming his third gold in moscow as he anchored jamaica to victory in the men is 4x100m relay. the fastest man in the world charged clear of united states rival justin gatlin as the jamaican quartet of nesta carter, kemar bailey cole, nickel ashmeade and bolt won in 37.36 seconds. the u.s finished second in 37.56 seconds with canada taking the bronze after britain were disqualified for a faulty handover. the 26 year old bolt has now collected eight gold medals at world championships, equaling the record held by american trio carl lewis, michael johnson and allyson felix, not to mention the small matter of six olympic titles. the relay triumph followed individual successes in the 100 and 200 meters in the russian capital. i am proud of myself and i will continue to work to dominate for as long as possible, bolt said, having previously expressed his intention to carry on until the 2016 rio olympics. victory was never seriously in doubt once he got the baton safely in hand from ashmeade, while gatlin and the united states third leg runner rakieem salaam had problems. gatlin strayed out of his lane as he struggled to get full control of their baton and was never able to get on terms with bolt. earlier, jamaica is women underlined their dominance in the sprint events by winning the 4x100m relay gold, anchored by shelly ann fraser pryce, who like bolt was completing a triple. their quartet recorded a championship record of 41.29 seconds, well clear of france, who crossed the line in second place in 42.73 seconds. defending champions, the united states, were initially back in the bronze medal position after losing time on the second handover between alexandria anderson and english gardner, but promoted to silver when france were subsequently disqualified for an illegal handover. the british quartet, who were initially fourth, were promoted to the bronze which eluded their men is team. fraser pryce, like bolt aged 26, became the first woman to achieve three golds in the 100 200 and the relay. in other final action on the last day of the championships, france is teddy tamgho became the third man to leap over 18m in the triple jump, exceeding the mark by four centimeters to take gold. germany is christina obergfoll finally took gold at global level in the women is javelin after five previous silvers, while kenya is asbel kiprop easily won a tactical men is 1500m final. kiprop is compatriot eunice jepkoech sum was a surprise winner of the women is 800m. bolt is final dash for golden glory brought the eight day championship to a rousing finale, but while the hosts topped the medal table from the united states there was criticism of the poor attendances in the luzhniki stadium. there was further concern when their pole vault gold medalist yelena isinbayeva made controversial remarks in support of russia is new laws, which make the propagandizing of non traditional sexual relations among minors a criminal offense. she later attempted to clarify her comments, but there were renewed calls by gay rights groups for a boycott of the 2014 winter games in sochi, the next major sports event in russia.

       "2      kansas city, missouri the general services administration, already under investigation for lavish spending, allowed an employee to telecommute from hawaii even though he is based at the gsa is kansas city, missouri, office, a investigation has found. it cost more than 24,000 for the business development specialist to travel to and from the mainland united states over the past year. he is among several hundred gsa virtual workers who also travel to various conferences and their home offices, costing the agency millions of dollars over the past three years. under the program, employees work from home and may live in another state from the region in which they are actually assigned. the kansas city employee, who started his job in january 2011, is paid 84,440 and works from his home in honolulu, a gsa representative confirmed. in the past year, according to gsa travel records, the employee has flown back to the mainland nine times for conferences and meetings. four of those trips were to st. louis four were to washington, with a side trip to cincinnati and one was to san diego. the total cost to taxpayers was 24,221. jason klumb, the gsa is regional administrator for kansas city, defended the hire. the cost of that travel was included in the consideration of his candidacy as an employee as compared with the other applicants, klumb said. and when factoring all of those in, it was determined that he was the best candidate, even in light of the cost that would be incurred. klumb called the gsa is teleworking program a successful program that is going to lead to cost savings for taxpayers. but a gsa spokeswoman said, we are not going to defend this type of travel. and a gsa employee in kansas city, who requested anonymity, said that hiring someone in hawaii to work for the kansas city region was ludicrous. it does not make sense, the employee said. when you consider everything you need when you hire someone, it would have been better to look for someone in the kansas city area. it would have reduced the cost of travel by at least 70 percent when you look at just the airfare of what it takes to from honolulu to washington, d.c., where a lot of business is done. dan tangherlini, who was appointed acting gsa administrator this year, said the agency was examining the cost of the entire teleworking program. i think the most important part for the gsa to think about is make sure we open ourselves up, avail ourselves to all the smart people in the country, but then also make sure we have a clear business case, he said. if we have someone who is working in nebraska but reporting to boston, there has to be a clear explanation for what value they are providing, and you have got to give me the business case. you have got to explain to me why that is a cost effective move for the american people, and that is a new standard that we are asking everyone at gsa to adhere to. the gsa virtual employee program is different from telework programs offered by many private companies including is parent company, turner broadcasting, in which some employees are encouraged to work from home some days of the week, partially to reduce traffic congestion. the house committee on oversight and government reform requested details about the gsa is teleworking program in june. that followed disclosures that 95 virtual employees, including 12 in supervisory positions, spent nearly 750,000 in travel costs between october 2010 and june 2011. the american people have a right to know that federal bureaucrats who enjoy the benefits of virtual work are eligible and responsible stewards of the taxpayer dollars that support the program, according to a letter from committee chairman rep. darrell issa, r california, to the gsa. the details requested by issa about the gsa program have not been provided to the committee. also requested the information more than two months ago through the federal freedom of information act but has been repeatedly told by the gsa that foia staff members have not finished compiling the material. the general services administration, which has more than 12,600 employees and a 26.3 billion budget, is a relatively obscure federal agency that handles government real estate and other non military procurement. congress launched an investigation into the gsa after a scathing inspector general is report issued this year showed lavish spending 823,000 at the agency is western regions conference in las vegas in october 2010. the controversy became politically toxic after reports and video clips of the lavish conference were released. the revelation prompted taxpayer indignation, embarrassed the administration and put a spotlight on wasteful spending by the gsa. jeff neely, the gsa official who organized the conference, resigned, as did the agency is administrator, martha johnson. two of johnson is deputies were fired, and eight other employees left the agency. tangherlini, a former treasury department official, took over as acting gsa administrator. in addition to the las vegas conference, the gsa apparently spent 330,000 to relocate an employee from denver to hawaii and probably millions more on other employees over a two year period, according to a transcript of an interview with a gsa event planner. and 84 gsa employees, most of them supervisors or other senior staff all subjects of inspector general investigations are still collecting their bonuses, totaling more than 1 million in taxpayer money. in july, a investigation revealed that the gsa is kansas city office spent more than 20,000 to send employees to cooking classes to build team spirit. while the classes do not amount to a significant sum of money in the world of trillion dollar government budgets, insiders said it was part of the free spending culture that went on for years at the gsa is kansas city regional headquarters. gsa spokeswoman betsaida alcantara said in a statement this year that all the agency is practices are under a top down review. is sara anwar, elizabeth m. nunez and tom cohen contributed to this report. watch erin burnett weekdays 7pm et. for the latest from erin burnett

       "3      los angeles a medical doctor in vancouver, british columbia, said thursday that california arson suspect harry burkhart suffered from severe mental illness in 2010, when she examined him as part of a team of doctors. dr. blaga stancheva, a family physician and specialist in obstetrics, said both burkhart and his mother, dorothee, were her patients in vancouver while both were applying for refugee status in canada. i was asked to diagnose and treat harry to support a claim explaining why he was unable to show up in a small claims court case, stancheva told in a phone interview. she declined to cite the case or burkhart is role in it. stancheva said she and other doctors including a psychiatrist diagnosed burkhart with autism, severe anxiety, post traumatic stress disorder and depression. the diagnosis was spelled out in a letter she wrote for the small claims court case, stancheva said. stancheva, citing doctor patient confidentiality, would not elaborate further, nor would she identify the psychiatrist involved in the diagnosis. burkhart, a 24 year old german national, has been charged with 37 counts of arson following a string of 52 fires in los angeles. the charges are in connection with arson fires at 12 locations scattered through hollywood, west hollywood and sherman oaks, according to authorities. stancheva said the refugee applications by burkhart and his mother were denied by the canadian government, and she has not seen burkhart since early march of 2010. i was shocked and dismayed at what happened in los angeles, and it appears he was not being treated for his depression, she said. burkhart was in court on wednesday for a preliminary hearing. prosecutors said his rage against americans, triggered by his mother is arrest last week, motivated his campaign of terror with dozens of fires in hollywood and nearby communities. burkhart kept his eyes closed and remained limp during most of his hearing, requiring sheriff is deputies to hold him up. the district attorney called his courtroom behavior very bizarre. this defendant has engaged in a protracted campaign in which he has set, the people believe, upwards of 52 arson fires in what essentially amounts to a campaign of terror against this community, los angeles county deputy district attorney sean carney said. the people believe he has engaged in this conduct because he has a hatred for americans. carney told the court burkhart would flee the country if he was allowed out of jail on bond, but los angeles superior court judge upinder kalra said he had no choice but to set bail. to go free while awaiting trial, burkhart must post a 2.85 million bond and surrender his german passport. it was revealed that burkhart is also under investigation for arson and fraud in relation to a fire in neukirchen, near frankfurt, germany. the worst arson sprees in the city is history began last friday morning with a car fire in hollywood that spread to apartments above a garage, but no new fires have happened since burkhart was arrested monday, los angeles district attorney steve cooley said. no one was hurt in the fires, but property damage costs are likely to reach 3 million, authorities said. cooley called it almost attempted murder, because people were sleeping in apartments above where burkhart allegedly set cars on fire with incendiary devices placed under their engines. the criminal complaint filed wednesday also alleged that the fires were caused by use of a device designed to accelerate the fire, cooley said. if found true, the allegation could mean additional custody time for the defendant. in numerous instances, the cars were parked in carports, resulting in the fires spreading to the adjacent occupied apartment buildings, a sworn affidavit from a los angeles arson investigator said. the vast majority of these fires occurred late at night when the occupants of the apartment buildings were asleep. investigator edward nordskog is affidavit detailed burkhart is behavior a day before the fires began, when he was in a federal courtroom during extradition proceedings for his mother. while in the audience, the defendant burkhart began yelling in an angry manner, f k all americans. the defendant also attempted to communicate with his mother who was in custody. shortly thereafter, the defendant was ejected from the courtroom by deputy u.s. marshals, nordskog wrote. dorothee burkhart was arrested a day before on an international arrest warrant issued by a district court in frankfurt, germany, said federal court spokesman gunther meilinger. the 53 year old german woman is wanted on 16 counts of fraud and three counts of embezzlement, he said. the charges include an allegation that she failed to pay for a breast enhancement operation performed on her in 2004, meilinger said. most of the german charges, however, stem from phony real estate deals that dorothee burkhart allegedly conducted between 2000 and 2006. it is my opinion that the defendant is criminal spree was motivated by his rage against americans and that by setting these fires the defendant intended to harm and terrorize as many residents of the city and county of los angeles as possible, nordskog wrote. a search of burkhart is hollywood apartment found newspaper clippings about the los angeles fires and articles from germany reporting similar car fires in frankfurt, germany in september, 2011, the investigator said. it is my opinion based on my experience that it is highly likely the defendant has a history of setting arson fires in germany before he came to the united states, nordskog wrote. burkhart is mother is scheduled for another extradition hearing friday, while he is due back in court for arraignment on january 24. meanwhile, both burkharts are housed in a los angeles jail.

       "92574  washington a second grand jury is decision not to indict a white police officer in the death of an unarmed black man once again had ripple effects that quickly spread from the streets on new york city to reach the halls of capitol hill. the decision not to indict a new york city police officer in the chokehold death of eric garner, a black man who was suspected of illegally selling cigarettes, came just nine days after another grand jury decided not to indict a white police officer in ferguson, missouri in the death of black teenager michael brown. the news led to another night of protests in major cities nationwide, including washington, d.c. president barack obama vowed not to let up in his efforts to ease racial tensions, and some democrats tried to channel demonstrators outrage in their reactions overnight and into thursday morning. and it was a rare development that brought members of both parties together in calling for further investigation. rep. cathy mcmorris rodgers, chairwoman of the house republican conference, said thursday morning that the house should absolutely hold hearings to investigate garner is death. we all have a lot of serious questions that need to be addressed and we need to understand what happened, why this decision was made, mcmorris rodgers said on msnbc is morning joe. i would call for the house to have those hearings so that we can better understand. but we need to take action, appropriate action, making sure our local law enforcement have the training, that they are using appropriate force, which i think we all recognize these are tragedies and it has raised a lot of questions. referring to rodgers call for hearings, house speaker john boehner said he would not rule that in or out, but said there are a lot of unanswered questions that americans have, and frankly i have. i do think that the american people deserve more answers about what really happened here and was our system of justice handled properly, boehner said thursday during a press conference. black leaders in congress quickly slammed the decision not to indict new york city police officer daniel pantaleo in garner is death and called on the department of justice to investigate garner is death. rep. marcia fudge, chairwoman of the congressional black caucus, said wednesday she was deeply disappointed in the decision not to indict pantaleo in garner is death and called the grand jury is decision yet another sad day for our country and our democracy. in the span of two weeks, this nation seems to have heard one message loud and clear there will be no accountability for taking black lives. as an american, it is growing increasingly difficult to believe that there is justice for all, she said in a statement. black lives do matter and our lives do hold value. rep. hakeem jeffries, the black caucus incoming whip who represents parts of new york city, called the grand jury is decision a stunning miscarriage of justice in a statement wednesday and said the decision makes clear that equal protection under the law does not exist for all americans. and jeffries said thursday that the incidents should serve as a catalyst for a wide shakeup in how cases involving police misconduct and potential crimes should be prosecuted. we need to look at broader reform and whether these type of cases should be handled by independent, special prosecutors so that we can have some measure of fairness and a real full and fair investigation, jeffries said on is new day. jeffries called the altercation between garner and the police officer, which was caught on video, a living breathing example of probable cause to indict. nearly a dozen times, garner tries telling the officer that he can not breathe and jeffries noted that garner even put his hands up in the air, but pantaleo continued to choke him. protests featuring slogans like hands up, do not shoot, black lives matter and now i can not breathe broke out again wednesday in reaction to the staten island grand jury is decision as demonstrators called for justice for garner and brown, the black teenager who was shot by police officer darren wilson in ferguson this summer. amid outcry from democrats on capitol hill and mostly silence from congressional republicans, two new york gop congressman defended the grand jury is decision wednesday not to indict nypd officer pantaleo. rep. peter king thanked the grand jury on twitter for doing justice and said later on that he felt strongly the police officer should not have been indicted. related rep. peter king thanks staten island grand jury for wouldoing justice rep. michael grimm, who represents staten island in congress, called the grand jury decision fair and reasoned in a statement wednesday and thanked the district attorney in the incident for handling the grand jury case with the utmost integrity. staten island is new york is whitest burrough and a majority of the grand jurors in the case were white. grimm did not fare so well at the hands of another grand jury last spring, when he was indicted on tax and other fraud charges. u.s. attorney general eric holder heeded calls from congressional leaders to launch a federal investigation and later wednesday formally announced that the justice department is leading a civil rights investigation into garner is death. president obama had also weighed in wednesday saying he had spoken with holder and said we are not going to let up until we see a strengthening of the trust and a strengthening of accountability that exists between our communities and law enforcement. holder is announcement came after sen. kirsten gillibrand of new york joined members of the congressional black caucus in calling on the justice department to investigate the staten island death. sen. kirsten gillibrand called the decision shocking and called garner is death a tragedy that demands accountability. nobody unarmed should die on a new york city street corner for suspected low level offenses, she said in a statement. u.s. attorney loretta lynch, obama is nominee to succeed holder as u.s. attorney general, will lead the investigation into garner is death. sen. chuck schumer, also of new york, said he was confident lynch will conduct a tough but fair investigation into the tragic death of eric garner. sen. rand paul, a kentucky republican and would be 2016 presidential contender who has specialized in reaching out to minority voters, blamed high taxes on cigarettes in the empire state as partially to blame for putting police officers in a dangerous situation with bad laws. .

       "92575  los angeles california gov. jerry brown will seek an immediate stay of what he called an unprecedented federal court order to release almost 10,000 inmates to relieve prison overcrowding by the end of the year, he said thursday. a three judge federal court panel ordered the state to reduce its prison population to 137.5 of design capacity by december 31 and threatened to find the state in contempt if california does not report on its progress every two weeks, thursday is ruling said. california has the nation is largest prison system and says it has been reducing overcrowding. the case grows out of lawsuits filed in 1990 and 2001 that alleged overcrowding is at the core of a domino effect of unsafe and unhealthy conditions for those on both sides of the iron bars. when plaintiffs filed motions to convene the three judge court panel in november 2006, california is prisons were at 202 of design capacity. in 2011, the u.s. supreme court upheld a three judge federal panel is determination that california is medical and mental health care for inmates falls below a constitutional level of care and that the only way to meet the requirements is by reducing prison crowding. the supreme court in 2011 found that california is shortcomings in prison medical and mental health care resulted in needless suffering and death and recognized the federal court is prison reduction order was of unprecedented sweep and extent, thursday is ruling said. the high court affirmed that order in full in 2011. on thursday, the three u.s. district court judges expressed impatience with california officials, the defendants in the case. the history of this litigation is of defendants repeated failure to take the necessary steps to remedy the constitutional violations in its prison system, the order said. it is defendants unwillingness to comply with this court is orders that requires us to order additional relief today. the three judge panel added that the plaintiffs request for a court order to show why california should not be held in contempt has considerable merit. our first priority, however, is to eliminate the deprivation of constitutional liberties in the california prison system, the three judges said in their ruling. we will therefore defer ruling on plaintiffs motion, and defer instituting any contempt proceedings related to defendants prior acts until after we are able to determine whether defendants will comply with this order. court documents also show that defer was not only all capitalized but also printed in bold face.

       "92576  norfolk, virginia the second mate of the houston express probably could not believe what he was seeing. hundreds of miles from land there was a small boat nearby. at first it looked abandoned. it was in bad shape, listing to one side. the crew of the 1,000 foot long container ship thought it was a yacht that had wrecked. incredibly, as they got closer, they saw there was a man on it, signaling for help. he was moving, walking around, waving to us and in surprisingly good condition, capt. thomas grenz told by phone friday. that man, louis jordan, 37, had an amazing story. he would been drifting on the 35 foot pearson sailboat for more than two months since leaving conway, south carolina, to fish in the ocean. just a few days into his trip, a storm capsized his boat and broke his mast. one of his shoulders was broken, too, so he could not fix the boat right away. eventually he was able to rig a makeshift mast and sail, but he could make little headway against the currents. it took so long, jordan said. it moved so slowly. the boat capsized two more times before he was rescued, according to jordan. his father, frank jordan, told is jim sciutto that he was expecting his son to look different. he looked good. had not lost too much weight. he was not badly sunburned like i thought he probably would be, he said. lost at sea for 66 days after his food and water ran out, it became an issue of survival. collecting fresh water was a nightmare for jordan. the weather would not cooperate. records show there were more than a dozen storms off the coast of the carolinas during the time he was missing. the precipitation came at night during harsh conditions. i had tried to collect rain water ... but every time the waves would splash into the boat, jordan said. the waves would put saltwater into my freshwater and it tasted bad. finally the conditions were right. i filled up my water tank, which is 25 gallons. i filled up a bucket. then there was the issue of food. the fish were not cooperating, but after a while jordan learned they were attracted to his laundry, which he would put out to sea for a rinse. the fish would swim in and out of his clothes and he could easily scoop them up with a hand net, he said. jordan came ashore thursday evening. affiliate wavy in norfolk, virginia, reported that he was able to walk from the helicopter into sentara norfolk general hospital about 7 30 p.m. coast guard officials have said they have found no reason to doubt jordan is incredible story. they noted that his father contacted them january 29 to report his son and his boat missing. frank jordan addressed the skepticism about his son is appearance, saying the boat stayed afloat and upright most of the time. his son spent most of his days in the cabin, out of the sun. frank jordan said it was obvious when the jordans met at the hospital friday morning that his normally low key and private son had been through an ordeal. i know he went through what he went through, frank jordan said. jordan is an unemployed truck driver who lived on his boat at a marina in conway. he had free rent and free food in the river, he said. but when it became difficult to catch dinner, he took off for the ocean in hopes he would land some bigger fish. frank jordan told is wolf blitzer on thursday that he had worried about his son, who is an inexperienced sailor, but he held hope because his son had a good boat. and he had the strength to make it. he is got a very strong constitution and is strong not only physically, but spiritually, frank jordan said. and he told me on the phone that he was praying the whole time, so i believe that sustained him a great deal. rescue swimmer kyle mccollum was the first to care for jordan on the flight back to land. you would expect sunburns, severe sunburn, blisters maybe ... a bunch of medical issues that could possibly be wrong with him, he said. but for him to be in his current state was pretty amazing. grenz was also surprised by jordan is condition, physically and mentally. the rescued sailor knew almost exactly what day it was, remarkable for someone who had been on the water for more than 60 days. jordan was dehydrated and said he was hungry. we took him to a rescue boat, the container ship captain said. he was given water and pea soup to gain some power again. derriel morris, a neighbor at the bucksport plantation marina rv resort called jordan a nice guy who loved his 47 year old boat, named angel. morris said it was immaculate, it was gorgeous, beautifully painted. i mean it looked like a brand new sailboat. morris told affiliate wpde that one day in january he was going to the store and jordan asked him to bring back some coffee creamer. but when he returned to the marina, jordan had slipped away. there was no shore line, no hose it was like he was never there, morris told the station. after he disappeared others who also live there held a candlelight ceremony. the marina is manager, jeff weeks, told wpde that jordan is expected to be back at buscksport next week. tales of people who cheated death after days, weeks adrift

welcome to student news first up u.n. general assembly azuz first up, leaders from around the world are coming together for a meeting in new york city. it is the united nations general assembly, and it gets together every year. the group is going to talk about world issues different leaders will make speeches. president obama is scheduled to address the assembly today. so what why does it matter that a bunch of leaders are having a meeting well, the united nations general assembly is made up of 192 countries. and when we say they are talking about world issues, we mean big subjects, like poverty and security, and specific things, like the war in afghanistan or iran is nuclear program. they can not create new laws. but the decisions that they make and the policies that they come up with can have a big influence on what goes on in the world. health care provisions azuz in the health care reform bill that you see president obama signing over my shoulder here, that might have been his biggest victory of his first two years in office. and parts of that law go into effect this week. for example, you can stay on your parents health insurance until you are 26, and insurance companies can not turn down children with medical conditions that exist at the time they apply for insurance. some people were and still are against this law, though. for one thing, it can cost a lot

word the sector of a country is economy that is not run by its government private sector that is the word cuban economy azuz running a business in the private sector means risks and rewards. you can set your own prices, but there is no one to really fall back on if things do not go so well. shasta darlington looks at what is in store for thousands of cubans who are about to lose their government jobs and make the shift into the private sector. begin video shasta darlington, correspondent, havana a tall order in communist cuba finding jobs for half a million laid off workers in the private sector. here in old havana, not everyone is celebrating this capitalist notion. like it or not, employees at this barbershop around the corner are being pushed off the state payroll and handed the shop. they will be able to set prices and keep earnings, but they will now have to pay taxes and rent, and there is no longer the guarantee of a fixed income. gerardo, havana barber translated i have been working for the state for years now and i am not interested in going private, says gerardo. i want to keep working for the state. darlington cuba plans to shed ten percent of public sector jobs over the next six months and allow more private enterprise to absorb the unemployed. a dramatic attempt by president raul castro to reshape the sputtering economy. he says the state simply can not afford a bloated and unproductive workforce. but do not expect american style big business. cuba is new entrepreneurs will be encouraged to start small operations, maybe driving taxis, laying bricks or perhaps repairing toys. now, to get an idea of what is in store for them, we are talking to some of the people already working in the country is miniscule private sector. emilio mendoza was laid off during cuba is last major economic crisis in the 90s. he bought a government license and set up a cobbler is shop in his driveway. he says cubans should see this as an opportunity. isidro, a taxi driver, says it depends on how much the state charges its new entrepreneurs in taxes and licensing fees. they all agree, the days of getting paid by the government, whether you work or lounge about, are over. still, the state controls about 90 percent of the economy. these modest proposals are not likely to radically shift that balance, but they will give life to a new class of small businesses
